Nor do I except them to give two flying sh!ts about their reviews, because their lives are probably just as miserable as their burger flipping salary.  

I've come here twice and both times my order was messed up, getting a hold of a manager was like five nights at Freddy's , and finally after contacting the dimwits I got a refunded order. After being treated like I was an inconvenience, I finally got to the window to order ( because their shitty microphones don't work) and decided to add a coca-cola, and a burger ( seeing as I just got off work and was hungrier then a hippo). The broad at the window acted as if her life was in shambles over the request, so I just smiled and continued on my way to the next window, where I was greeted by a nice young man who has worked a 12 hour shift, from what I was told and was scheduled to work even longer because the dipshit (my words not his) managers obviously can't make a schedule. Not only did the dumb broad from the first window start  squawking from the back but she was so annoying the poor man needed a break. I eventually got my food, and checked to make sure the food was there. Thankfully it was, and I didn't need to give the girl a experience she was not prepared for, but I asked for her name. SURPRISINGLY  HER NAME WAS MICKY. WHO WORKS AT MICKY DS.  amused with her life, I thanked her and drove away.

 I've had multiple problems with the crew in this store since they re-opened, but yesterday evening took the cake.  I went in to pick up some last minute food for the family and was immediately suspicious when I saw half a dozen people milling about unhappily at the food pickup location, an no one giving them food.  When I questioned the cashier about the delay, another customer actually came back and demanded a refund because she couldn't wait any longer.  When I noticed that half of the crew seemed to be sitting in the dining room watching TV. 
  
 I've been to this store frequently and there is definitely a pattern or very very poor and incompetent service. Almost every order I've placed had something forgotten or incorrect. There are always crewmembers milling around doing nothing, playing with the TV or in case, rapping behind the counter.

 I've just had it with this store, I plan on avoiding it until the get some people actually interested in serving their customers, and I would strongly advise others to do the same.  At this point I wouldn't even trust the food that comes out of their kitchen.

UPDATE:   I was able to reach a regional manager via email, and he replied briefly that it was a situation that was being addressed.  In the last month, I have been there 2 or 3 times with simple take-out orders and everything seemed to go fine. Got what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time and everyone on the crew were if not working, not blatantly goofing off. So added a Star to the rating, even though I'm still kind of leary."

Ok - here is where consistency was extremely lacking in this well known chain. 

Nothing was good - right from the phony looking decorations and fake plants to the managers attitude!

Before ordering - I asked if I could get a milkshake because it was early and was told yes - I proceeded to order my meal along with three other colleagues. The order was messed up as soon as the person taking the order realized she couldn't get me my milkshakes, which meant she had over charged our credit card. She had no idea what to do about that and had to get the manager who then acted like it was my fault and refunded the cash for one milkshake. However, there were two ordered and two charged so she had to then refund more cash - these milkshakes costs over three additional bucks over the normal price of the meal we ordered that included drinks - I know confusing. So after refunding the cash - I asked what I could get to drink and she said that would cost more - there was no drinks that would come with my meal???? So I just got a freaking glass of ice water!

The place was not clean - the service was P@## Poor and I would NEVER return to this location.

But I must say that Wendy's has pretty good burgers. The fact that they aren't frozen helps. I prefer the 1/2 Lb. Double Cheeseburger with everything, by the way. They also try to have an expansive menu that hits the target sometimes but also misses a bit.

My opinion on Frostys (Frosties?): They  are best after they've been in the freezer for a couple of hours and then eaten with a real spoon, not a plastic one. 

However, the service at every Wendy's seems to be seriously lacking. We've only ever gotten drive-thru at this location, and they always forget something or make an error. The staff also appears to be overstressed and overworked and surely underpaid.

Opened the other sandwich I purchased to see if the same mistake was made on that one, and it was. In addition to not being the correct order as I had placed it a few distinguishable bites had been taken out of one.

The first time I had it I ordered the regular cheese burger. Tip for the ladies whose mouths and stomachs don't expand like a boa constrictor's... go ahead and order the little sized burgers. They are still plenty big to hate yourself for consuming so many calories, but not so big you feel like you can't eat for a week. 

Of course the biggest perk is the mass amount of free toppings you can add to your burger. It's hard to decide, and yes there are some wrong answers.

To me, yes they have the exact same concept and similar menus, but there is no comparing the two.

Fair warning, if your allergic to peanuts, this is not a place for you. They cook in peanut oil. On the bright side, Five Guys is excellent for those who can only eat Gluten Free. The fries have a dedicated fryer, and you can get your burgers, shall say protein style. In & Out is better in their protein style because of the way they prep the lettuce. Five Guys has shreds of lettuce that they sort of make a burger sandwich. Usually if you add extras on, everything ends up falling out and you are left with a huge mess.

One of the biggest downsides to Five Guys in the calorie count. Ohio, you would think twice if you actually saw the calorie content next to the menu items.

Overall, the service was Friendly and quick. The place was clean and I really didn't have any complaints. Great place for a quick bite to eat, if you want to go on the lighter side, I would recommend the "little" options."

When he got home I saw that there was an unusual amount of Big Mac sauce on my Big Mac. So I went to wipe some off and there looked like there was spit mixed into my Big Mac... So I asked my autistic brother if his food tasted funny or anything. He told me that his first sandwich tasted alright but the second one tasted gross and had a funny texture so he threw it away. So I called this McDonald's from the phone number on the receipt, asked to speak with a manager, and tried to explain the situation but she was short with me and hung up after I asked "Do I needed to take this to corporate because you said you can't do anything about it?". Honestly I doubt she was even the manager because of her poor customer service and how she handled herself, but Im just furious that people would screw with a handicapped persons food.. Don't eat here, it's not worth it. You've got a bunch of people here willing to screw over and mess with handicapped people's food.. Avoid this place at all costs, worst McDonald's in the area for sure.

But the situation inside is fairly ridiculous.  The crew during the day seems to be over a dozen employees, but they only ever have one person taking orders, and you have to wait on that person to wander back to their post to actual sell you some food.  You can see half a dozen employees in the back apparently working on cooking food, but all those people still can't get your food out in less than 10 minutes. But while you are waiting you can watching another half dozen employees at the take-out window chatting the day away while one person occasionally fills up a bag and gets an order out.

They have an interesting ordering system which consists of around 8 predesigned meals.  It is assumed that one will want a burger, fries and a beverage.  Word of warning- there are no chairs at the order counter.  I had to bring one from the dining area while I decided what to order.  After contemplating the menu for about 15 minutes, I decided on the Number 1 Meal, at which point I got up and approached the counter where I would place my order with the cashier.  When I finished, I went back to my chair but a staff member had taken it to a table for me.

Now, I love the fact that patrons are allowed to fill AND refill their own drinks.  This is wonderful!  I can have more than one fill, and I don't have to keep getting the same thing.  After I drank my first large DR. Pepper, I decided to switch to vanilla shakes.  This machine isn't as conveniently located as the soda machine but I still went behind the counter three or four times for refills.

Now to the food. I absolutely love reviewing chef's personally inspired dishes.  And the chef creating meals at this McDonald's is among the great chefs of Bainbridge, Ohio.  This burger, I highly recommend.  It was a work of art:  2 all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.  "Big Mac!"  I was dying to find out what the "special sauce" was made from.  I'd guess something like French truffles, saffron, cardamom, and pigmy goat cream.  When I went to the counter to ask the chef, he wouldn't reveal his secret.  He tried to fool me by saying, "I don't know, man.  It squirts from a gun."  Yeah, right buddy!  Some joker behind me said, "it's ketchup and mayo!  You're holding up the line!"  Alas, the secret of the sauce may never be revealed to me but at least I have my blissful memories.

Now to the french fries.  Oh my goodness!  One of these days, McDonald's fries will be known all over the state.  At the risk of sounding lewd, these french fries are better than a french kiss.  They are toe curling spine tingling.  And that little bag of ketchup they give you, FOR FREE, is the perfect amount.  Although it was a little challenging dipping more than one fry at a time in to the bag.

Now I really wanted one last free refill on my milkshake but it must have been getting too busy for them, because the manager politely asked me to leave.  I assume they needed my table.  But she was very polite.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I talked to someone that was so polite.  She even worded it politely- "Sir!  I'm going to have to politely ask you to leave."  
"No problem," I said.  "Just let me finish refilling my milkshake."

Anyway, the restaurant is fantastic, the chef is a genius and the manager is remarkably polite.  I love this place.  I would have given it 4 stars but I gave it 3 because I ordered nachos and they said they didn't have any.  But I know they do.  Everybody else in the whole place ordered nachos!  Every time an order was ready at the counter, I'd go see if it was mine and the guy behind the counter would say, "That is nachos!"  And of course I ordered a burger, but I wanted nachos.
Also, I left a $5 tip for my waiter but I think I saw a dishonest patron swipe it as I was walking out the door.  I hope next time I go there my service doesn't suffer because they think I didn't leave a tip."

I've had more experiences with this place but customer service is a 0 if I had to rate it. Every time I go there it's always something bad...

All in all, it wasn't that bad.  The burgers were greasy.  The fries are fresh cut and greasy.  They have a never-ending supply of (free!) peanuts all over the store.  An added bonus is that all of their toppings are free so be sure to load up your burgers.  The service was fairly quick but the place was hopping so I expected at least a few minutes of wait.

The only thing that confused me was the menu.  I know I could have asked for clarification on the burgers but, because the place was packed, I didn't want to be "that customer" that holds everyone up.  If you order a 'hamburger' or 'cheeseburger' keep in mind that it is TWO patties, not one.  Had I known this, I would have ordered the 'little hamburger' and 'little cheeseburger', which is only one patty.  I was so full after I ate my meal that I could hardly move most of the night.

I was also a little bummed out that they posted signs EVERYWHERE informing customers not to take peanuts out of the store due to "food allergies".  I understand the point but I could have bagged a ton of peanuts for future snacking.

A regular burger, side of small fries, and a medium drink ran me around $8.  Most of my friends think this is expensive for a burger, fries and drink but if you really think about it it's not too terribly far off from most fast food places.

So even if you have a small order & take the time to go inside, they will still serve the entire drive thru line before they bag up your food.

Have a nice day." Maybe she was having a bad day. NBD. Checked my food...no syrup or butter. ..a little annoyed, but not a huge deal. Park car. Get out in my wildly inappropriate leopard print pajama shorts to retrieve condiments. 

Wait. Wait. Wait patiently for someone to acknowledge me or state "can I help you?"

Girl eventually turns around after smacking a bag angerly out of her way and gives me a look with no words that clearly states, "WHAT?". Reaches over for condiments after I politely asked like I just asked her to pump maple syrup out of a tree for me. Hands them to me without a simple sorry, eye contact, nothing.

I work in the service industry and have since I was 15, so I do understand. I'm not just another asshole looking for handouts. 
I pull up to the screen to order and am created with "start with your order" or something along those lines. Not a very good start. Tells me to pull to the window for my total. The wait wasn't as long as it usually is, I think I went from ordering to receiving my order in 5 minutes max, however the usual wait time is awful.  The older woman with glasses (and blonde hair maybe?) at the window was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional. She tells me my total and goes to cash me out, but leaves the window open. She then proceeds to get shitty with the person trying to order and yells out "GO HOME" before closing the window and storming off.  The young girl who gave me my food after this was very professional and did tell me to have a good night (which is usually skipped over).

Today was hot, humid and I really wasn't terribly motivated to rush home to a hot apartment to cook and pack to move. So I thought swing on by Wendy's, have a small salad in their air conditioning and charge my phone while skillfully avoiding packing.

They have parking on both sides of the restaurant in as well as in back. But what is it with these fast food restaurants? Another case of "you have to walk through the drive-thru in order to enter the building".  Am I the only one that sees a possible lawsuit and an accident waiting to happen? No? Good! I thought it was just me.

 This is a rather large restaurant, with plenty of table seating and a few booths. There's also counter seating on either side of the store, overlooking the scenic parking lot. The advantage here is they they have outlets to charge your phone. They also have two more outlets on either side of the gas fireplace, which dominates about one third of the dining room. I sat at a counter, charging my phone and ate my half Berry Burst salad. It was fresh and flavorful. It would have been great if it had as many strawberries as blueberries and feta. It was on a bed of greens, mostly leaf lettuce. The moment I saw iceberg, I booted it, especially since it was brown. I have zero patience for that. I also have no patience for the trash that sat on two tables and around the trash basket the whole time I was here (90 minutes). They had plenty of employees and very few customers. So, no. No excuse. 

All the employees are always polite, just not friendly. They usually say (in a bored, flat tone) "hi can I take your order?" as if it's a run-on sentence. Still, they manage to get the orders correct, just slowly. As with every fast food place, the drive-thru is their priority. I'm old enough to remember when fast food was fast. And cheap.

The Other reason is the place just feels dirty to me and what I mean by this is that the floor is really sticky in my opinion. The Food was your typical mcdonalds food as the hasbrown tasted more like the oil in the fryer and was barely warm and the mcmuffin is what saves the day for this review because it was nice and hot the english muffin was warm and soft and it was really good and if it was not for the mcmuffin I would probably have rated this location a 1.

No ketchup on a cheeseburger that was ordered with nothing but cheese and ketchup and it had onions and pickles instead. Two singles that we specifically indicated should have no cheese -- you guessed it -- both had cheese and my daughter can't even eat cheese. Fries were suspiciously spicy -- other family members verified that it wasn't just me, that the barely-warm fries tasted like someone had accidentally sprinkled them with some type of spicy seasoning rather than salt.  The other burger had no ketchup when ketchup was on the order. Note that the young man who took the order did indeed enter all of it correctly (these were not weird requests, just things like ketchup only or no cheese). Lesson learned -- either 1) don't go here again because the order is rarely right, or 2) check the order by opening every item before driving away, not just making sure it was all there in the bag.

However, it always seems crowded and it just seems that their drive-thru is slow.  I pulled in when it seemed fairly empty and it still took a long time. I asked for an ice cream cone at the end of the summer season.  It didn't seem unreasonable to not have it as they offer shakes all year round.  They said the machine was being cleaned.  From my perspective, it just seemed like they didn't want to bother.  So we went to Wendy's for a frosty instead.

But the reason for my review being one star. Lack of responsible management. This place doesn't have a bad employee problem. This place has a bad management problem. Which leads to underperforming employees. I arrived at this location at 540.  I had to be at work two minutes away at 6 pm. It was not busy by any means. The drive thru had four cars in it.  I went inside.  The inside had one customer. I was late for my job.  
All I ordered were two McDoubles.  And a drink. I don't understand how it could happen.  
So let me get to the good part. One of the female employees had her foot on a shelf as she was waiting for the order to be prepared. No manager in sight. Another employee. Dropped an F-Bomb.  Realized she said it. And covered her mouth afterwards.  Just way to much conversation. That had nothing to do with expediting.  
If they are able to get good management. The employees will do just fine. Because when a female manager did step out from the back. Things quickened up.  And the team acted as a team.  And got orders out in a quick manner. Problem was.  I still was late for work.  So it happened too late.  If I didn't pay. I would've left. 
I will come back to this location. And give it another try. But there is a McDonald's less than one mile from this location.  So if this place is bad.  I will just drive to the other one."

I try to find positives in all my reviews but this one is tough.  I have waited in the drive through numerous times for 10 minutes plus to get the kids some happy meals as we are busy running them all over and it never fails the bigger the hurry I am in the longer the wait.  Sometimes when I see the line is long I go inside to try to avoid the long wait but to no avail the wait is just as long if not longer inside.  My son and I actually went inside sat down as we were in no hurry this time and there were several people in front of us waiting as well.  We ordered 2 fish sandwiches some fries and chicken nuggets and no joking waited 18 minutes to get our food.  I have had faster service at a sit down restaurant and far better food as well.  I guess the only positive I can say is that my order has never been cold, it is always fresh and hot.  My advice would be if you are truely in a hurry for fast food avoid this McDonald's as they are not a "fast" food restaurant.

This location recently underwent a renovation, and it probably should have stayed closed. There's clearly a management problem. It's always short-staffed and the crew that does come to work always seems distracted or pulled in several different directions. Yes, it's a fast food job, I get it. But one of the first rule of hospitality is to pleasantly greet your customers. I've waited for ten minutes at the drive thru waiting to place my order hearing a word or speaking up myself. It's a shame, because the location is great, but it's been run into the ground.	Wendy's	4524 Browns Hill Rd.	Pittsburgh	PA	15217	36	1	Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food	-79.925176	40.416731

This is by far the worst Wendy's and the worst fast food restaurant I have ever been too. Unfortunately this is very close to my home. I've been here at least a dozen times. Always rude service. Once walked in the store only to witness a cashier screaming at a customer when the customer pointed out they gave him the wrong burger. My experience was  similar that night. Today at noon, had a rude man in his late teens or early 20s basically rush me through my order, then he kinda tossed the food to me when I paid, didn't say a word. The burgers were dry and room temperature. The buns were stale. The Fry's were cold and soggy. Never again, I will never go to this Wendy's again. Sure if I go in they'll give me a coupon or something. Been there, done that.  It's a consistent issue and there are many options near by.

I have waited in the drive through for over 20 minutes and have seen several people ask for refunds due to long waits for food inside the restaurant. I have also witnessed cars order and then drive straight through because the wait times are too long. I have never seen anyone apologized to and  have even seen employees eating and drinking while working the front counter. I have talked to management and will be contacting ownership shortly.

Was told by employee to pull up to window one to place my order. There was no employee at window one. Sat behind the car in front of me for 13 minutes. Of course, there is no way to leave once you're in the drive thru lane, or I would have. The person in the car in front of me received her bag of food TWICE and gave both bags back. The employee should have parked that car so other customers could be taken care of. I've already been told to park when all I ordered was an iced coffee.

We went through the drive through at 11pm.  Or I should say we tried to go through the drive through at 11pm.  We were leaving the theaters with two kids and trying to get a late bite on the way back to our hotel. There was a guy in the store trying to sweet, the lights were on, the menus were lit.  Everything indicated it was a typical late night drive through Wendy's.  There were two cars in front of us.  We sat at the speaker, nothing.  At one point we heard someone say a chopped word, but it was unintelligible.  After a few minutes we drove up.  Watched the SUV in front of us apparently try to get their order right for 5 minutes. Then pulled up.  The guys there ignored us.  After rapping on the window, they said they were closed. I told them they ignored us at the speaker, now ignored us at the window, and they're supposed to be open, signs are lit, the hours said they were still open.  The guy says one word, "truck."  I had no idea what that meant, so he says "we got a truck."  Now how is ANY customer supposed to know what that means?  And why does getting a truck mean they get to ignore customers at the windows and make them wait for no reason? 

Everyone involved in that fiasco last night really shouldn't have a job.  They just didn't care. It would be one thing if they came on the speaker and said "I'm sorry sir, we're having issues and we're closed."   They just ignored us and wasted our time.  That's just plain ignorant.  Wendy's is one of our only and favorite fast food burger joints. They've now wasted my and my children's time and they're going to lose 5 or 10 sales, at ALL locations now, because I'm going to take my money elsewhere.  People go to franchises they know are open and for the same consistent quality and service.  This restaurant /franchisee broke that trust, and it's going to cost the company now.  

Judging from the ample very poor feedback I see on here, this location has a LOT of problems."	Wendy's	4524 Browns Hill Rd.	Pittsburgh	PA	15217	36	1	Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food	-79.925176	40.416731

This place takes and fills one order at a time.  I mean for real.  I walked in and was third in line to order my food.  I wasn't paying attention at first, but when I was next in line, I saw this first person.  They literally will take ONE order and go about their motions and just fulfill that ONE order.  And they do not do it at a fast place like you would think from a FAST food restaurant.

Once the person in front of me ordered I watched as they prepared the food.  Each item being put together one at a time.  I mean it was weird.  One part of an order will be put together and put in a bag, then the next item will be started.  It felt like an eternity waiting.  All the girl said to me while I watched this was, "I'll be right with you."  That was said multiple times.

Also part of the problem might be that they reserve their smiles and jovial tone for one another, not for the customer.  It was weird to see the notable change in affect when the girl came back to the register to take my order.  Went from a smile to dead on look.  No emotion when taking my order.  I'm glad you like the people you work with, but I could hear all of what you all were saying while I ate my food.  

As for the food, it was typical.  Let me touch on the fries though.  These things were coated thickly in salt.  I can confirm that too.  The thing they use to put the salt on the fries looks like a funnel that salt freely falls out of.

Although this place got an update on the interior, that does not mean it is clean.  After I had my food in hand I had to scour the restaurant for a halfway decently cleaned table.  As I ate my food I noticed that the place was not busy but not a single employee came out to attend to the tables that clearly were dirty.  To boot, management was on property doing interviews but did not address anything in the restaurant.

The cleanliness problem continued outside as well.  It looked like a fast food throw down had happened.  Not only was there Wendy's garbage, but Dunkin Donuts, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC garbage everywhere.  How did that happen when three of those four are nowhere near this place?

Oi!  Never again will I attempt to eat at this place."	Wendy's	4524 Browns Hill Rd.	Pittsburgh	PA	15217	36	1	Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food	-79.925176	40.416731

And get this... all I ordered was a breakfast biscuit and fries.... wow. I will never come here again. This is by far the worst service in history.

I continue the stare down, and he begrudgingly turns, walks further back, throws away the old gloves, washes his hands, and puts on new gloves. I maintain my stare never looking away. He again locks eyes with me and walks toward the burger production area. It felt like a long time of starring but was probably only 30 seconds to a minute.

We have a family member who is gravely ill and we are eating a LOT of fast food in this area, I can't remember the last time that we were able to cook a meal at home.

My sweetheart's dad is having serious issues swallowing and is having to drink thicken liquids at this point. Our research recommends Wendy's shakes for patients with this issue as the shakes apparently contain some ingredients that cause that cause them to melt slower.

For this reason we have been buying him lot's of Wendy's shakes. That is the good news. The bad news is that this is the closest Wendy's to where he is at and the service is consistently awful. 

Usually a fast food restaurant tends to put their best server on the drive-thru. I really, really hope that this is not the case. We've had the same server several times and she is consistently rude. The order is wrong about half of the time, and even the change given is consistently incorrect.

I've approached the managers on duty more than once and gotten the impression that they consider rudeness, wrong orders and wrong change just standard fast food business practice. The next day the same employee is in the window being rude and getting orders and change wrong.

The place is run down looking from the outside. There are two drive up windows. The first one is out of service and has been for a while. That's not a big deal. There is a sign in the window telling you to move to the next window. The sign is half falling down and faded. It's been in that condition for a long time. It is obvious that the management hasn't bothered to look at the outside of the building for a while. I'm honestly afraid to go inside as I don't want to know just how bad it is.

I purposely chose to review this restaurant as it is the worst example of fast food service in this area. I also reviewed the Taco Bell down the street as they always seem to do it exactly right.

Service is slow, ridiculously slow if you go at lunch on weekdays and the short retiree who wears the paper hat is alone at the register. Each rush-time order is meticulously misheard, miskeyed, and repeated. During the school year, don't even go between three and six, it becomes an impromptu aftercare program. 

I'm not sure what happened but immediately after the remodel, it was nice, clean, and well kept. There was music overhead. The volume of students was lower. Service was better and faster. I feel like an intervention is in order.

I've had wrong orders there a lot, listened to employees swear behind the counter, and memorably got served a cheeseburger that had literally been smashed flat - in the dining room. My expectations aren't high for McDonald's but they don't get met here. Ever.

And as long as I'm reviewing a McDonald's, can I ask why the "fresh" cooked patties don't taste as good as the frozen ones did? They seem distinctly different, and less flavored.

This franchisee really needs to tighten it up. Self order/self pay kiosks would be a great help. Go back to playing 50's music overhead, that was great at keeping teenagers from loitering...but do something soon, before the bottom falls out."

I live 2 blocks away and have had way more bad experiences than good. Every time I swear I won't go back, but it is so close to my house. I wish it were better. For example one time I used the drive thru, they asked me to pull ahead into one of the waiting spots and they'd bring my food out once it was ready, well they totally forgot about me. I sat there for at least 20 minutes before going inside to get my food and a refund. And the order was wrong, as usual. A very frustrating place to visit.

It was approximately six cars in the drive-through ahead of me. The store was lit up and so was the drive thru menu. The line was moving really slow I thought it was because they were so busy people were  taking a long time to place their order. By the time I got to the window it was 11:57. I was sitting there with window cracked waiting and saying hello getting poured on by rain.  I kept saying hello,  honked horn and still no answer. Now is like 1205 and like three cars behind me so I finally pull to window honk horn the guy comes to window.  I ask is the speaker broke? The guy says no we closed even though The Internet said they close at midnight.   I said I have been in line for about 30 minutes,  Several cars have. . He says oh we closed,  all our stuff shut down. I ask what time you close? He says 11:45. I say you suppose to close at 12 but you all just made up your own hours I suppose?  He chuckled and said yeah.  I'm sorry the speaker should have said we closed.  I say to him, So You guys wait until car comes to your window and you say you are closed but you don't bother to turn out lights or even say we closed at speaker?   So the line was long because we all saw a cars there at menu for long time then pull away. They were all waiting as well and when they didn't  get answer they were either pulling to window or pulling off but no one knew that.  This is just rude and unacceptable.

The food I got through the drive-thru was so bad I got back in my car and took it back for a refund. I asked the 12 year old manager to open the sandwich and look at the bacon. As you can see in my picture, it was totally burnt and inedible, and the burger was just about as bad. The arrogant kid looked at it and said "looks like our bacon". He amended his comment by saying maybe it was a little crisper than usual, but he'd be happy to refund my money. When he returned to the window, I told him he wasn't getting my point. I told him it was only the second time I've been there in a year, and both times it was inedible. He just got a smug smile on his face and didn't respond, so I told him not to bother apologizing since it would be too much for him. I honestly don't know how this restaurant stays open.

Empoyee workers could care less when I went back inside after biting into the thing and thinking "yech." Employees handed to manager and showed no interest whatsoever at this. Manager didn't know quite what to do .. offered to make me another - I told him I had no appetite for a burger now, please just give me a refund. The excuse I got was that the timer on the burger grill doesn't always work right, and sometimes opens the grill early. . 

You'd think they would be a little more concerned about serving uncooked meat. The staff are clueless and careless millenials.

The place was a little dirty but nothing out of the ordinary at a typical McDonald's. The employees kept shouting out back and forth about items they were out of. They didn't have any napkins left along with many other items. We watched multiple people walk in and walk right back out because they didn't have much to choose from.

What do I do?  i've wanted to try this place and considered this to be the best option in the moment, especially now that Sushi House closed there recently.  

I only had a regular burger.  I asked for just lettuce and tomato, but a few pieces of raw onion found their way on there somehow.  I'm sure that's easy to do, and it turned out to be more of a pleasant surprise, actually.  No big deal.  I guess it's a good thing I actually do like onion, and for those times you're trapped in an airport or desperate enough to look for something to eat in a shopping mall food court, this is a decent burger with a nice choice of sides with no extra charge (whether you order them or not).  

Next time I find myself in this situation,  I'll just go 'All The Way' and expect to find the onion along with everything else they decide to throw on there.   As far as fast food goes, I'd say this is pretty good stuff.

This seems short- but was actually about 14 minutes. Enough time to talk to BOTH parties about our issues. The manager on duty (Caucasian American female, heavy set, brown curly hair a bit past the shoulder) was very courteous. She referred to today as "babysitting" as she tries to fix everything, and I notice they have a sign EVERY Thursday they are interviewing people.

It can be grueling, crawling through all those smaller businesses with unique visions and wide eyes. As you stroll along the uniquely named businesses and the earbud-laden millenials, you may feel the world shrink around you. What are these things? Who are these people? Sometimes you just want to be reminded that corporate conglomerates work. That capitalism at its most craven still works. And make no mistake, a frozen square burger is capitalism at its most craven. You know what? It does kinda work.

Don't get me wrong. The food is not good. The employees are not excited. Nothing positive or uplifting or worthwhile is happening here. The menu is the same limited nonsense that every "classic" burger joint has. The food is prepared quickly and thrown at you in a grease-stained bag. But, as you stroll down one of the more unique streets in the country, can you get the same frosty and fries that you can also get in Topeka, KS? Yes, you sure can. The system works! Does it taste passable? I guess!

So let them have their bubble tea! Let them have their stupid frothed lattes! Let them have their mediterranean omelette situation! Let them have some stupid sandwich with "pesto" on it, whatever that is! You and I, pal, we will have a plain old square burger. We will stare misty-eyed at our Norman Rockwell calendar. We will receive our grease-stained bag and sigh wistfully because it feels like home. We will have muttered reservations about "those people," whoever they may be.

Thirdly, the management has displayed "motivational" signs chock full of spelling errors within view of guests. If I was an employee, I would actually be demotivated by these posters.

Kay and I had full bladders and couldn't stand Pi enough to want to relieve ourselves there. The 5th pizza place we wanted to try had become a full-on bar. I had seen another pizza parlor that I hadn't heard or read of before, so we made our way back up Carson to where we parked, in search of a bathroom and one more pizza place afterwards before ending our intensely chilled evening out on the tiles. 

When we went back to the bathrooms, we found that both were locked.

Oh, you KNOW how this works: A few heroin junkies spoil it for the straight-edgers like me. Damn it. 

We had to buy something before we'd be allowed to use the facilities. 

I went through this before at a McDonald's last year on St. Paddy's Day. Hey, I was pressured into downing a yard of green beer. 

Well, I orderd a Hi-C, and Kay had a Diet Coke. This was after waiting 20 minutes. 

The gruff manager said "I'll unlock the doors," with a smirk on his face. He had us. I smirked back since I knew what the racket was. 

I urinated for what was seemingly an eternity, got back to our seat, and sipped on the Hi-C...with a pizza box in front of us. The gaggle of high-school kids across from us thought that was funny.

"Do they eat Subway sandwiches at Wendys? Huh-huh-huh."

I felt like going over to explain our night to them but decided that it would be futile. What teenager even knows what Yelp is? 

Alas BK, your burgers are dry, your onion rings bland, and you add/remove too many items from your menu. As Ronnie Dio used to sing...

While we were here, we found someone to give our crappy Pi Coal Fired Pizza to.

P.S. My grandmother used to come to this BK when she was alive and living in South Side 2.5 decades ago. She would only come by to pilfer straws, sugar, plastic utensils, napkins, and coffee creamer.

Come around the bend from ordering at the sign and you may think you are about to be the first victim in a new horror flick.  The bushes are overgrown, weeds popping up around them.  Then you pull around and see you have to go through a dark tunnel.

A dim light flickers overhead, you hear the hum of your car engine and smell the exhaust.  You pull up to the rickety window and as it opens you almost expect an axe wielding murderer to be on the other side.  You silently pay for your food in fear that you may say the wrong thing to bring on the wrath of the employee.

As you quietly pull away, you think you're almost free until you hear the *ding ding* of the bell that reminds you of pulling up to the gas pumps.  As you pull back into the light of daylight you think to yourself, 'I survived!'

Well almost, that is until you discover now you have to dodge pedestrians on the sidewalk and then pray to god that you can get back onto Carson St.  Good luck with that.

I wouldn't step foot in this place.  Yes, it looks all nostalgic from the outside, but once you get inside it just looks rundown.

Their toppings are free and always fresh in my experience. I typically go with lettuce, tomato, pickle, grilled onion, and ketchup/mustard. Fries are also great and I love that they typically have vinegar available.

My biggest gripe? Price. I always order the "little" cheeseburger and "little" fry which basically means one party in the burger and the smallest fry available. Yet, when I do it costs $12.50 for a meal with a drink. I can basically eat at BRGR or Burgatory for this price. Ideally they would come up with a combo meal so that fries/drink do t add $5-6 to your order."

THE UP-SIDE:  Once in a while, we all eat at McDonalds.  This one happens to be very clean and nearly "nice" on the inside.  However...

THE DOWN-SIDE:  I've gone to this location several times over the past two years.  Each time, I went through the drive-through and had to endure a wait of over 10 minutes.  I literally waited 15 minutes in line on two different ocassions.  

So, just today when I visited, I thought, "Hmm.  I'll be smart this time.  I'll go inside to beat the line drive-through line wrapping around the building."  Well, I should have known better.  Inside, the line snaked to the door; just two feet from where I entered the restaurant.  They had one woman on the register and she was moving at a snail's pace.

I waited for a full 10 minutes - yes, I'm an idiot - and still hadn't even gotten to place my order.  In fact, there were still five people in front of me!  Frustrated and hating myself for giving this place yet another shot, I left without food and vowed NEVER TO RETURN.

THE SUM-IT-UP: I really don't like McDonalds that much, but I do think that they seem pretty well-run overall.  However, this particular location is an anomoly.  It's just downright horrid in it's customer service and nobody - I mean nobody - should ever stop here for "fast" food.

When you're on the road (long distance driving), eating options are few and far between them.  I kept hoping to find a Trader Joes or Whole Foods market but, no effing chance.

-------------------------------
Probably the worst "fast food" visit yet.  Not worst in the sense that I have a juicy story to share but that it took ever so long to get a small order fulfilled in comparison to their competitors next door.  Ya know, the motorist traveling the interstate is probably their most typical sort of consumer and their everyday challenge is to win some of that motorist business.  
I would think that Burger King would staff only their best to support these needs of the weary traveler, yes? Maybe?  Absolutely not.  
Their customer service is pretty good and their employees are able to converse appropriately but their turn around times in serving just plain STINK!.  In the not-so-recent past, upon visits to Chicago BK's I would remember staff asking drive-up customers to reverse or move forward so that they could fake out BK corporate about how quickly they could meet customer demand. (Faking out their drive-up window timers)  These kinds of requests were not made here.  Instead we waited and waited and waited, for typical, every-order, type BK items.  The wait was so long that we started taking note of how quickly their neighbor Arby's, were able to respond to their drive-up business in far more suitable times.

Originally we thought about hitting Arby's but they had a sizable line and for some reason we thought between the two fast food evils, this would be the better.

This is one of the larger Five Guys locations I've seen, and it is standard FG burgers (read: very good). A cheeseburger all-the-way with medium fries and a drink will set you back $12.58.  The burger is a hot mess.  That's a good thing - hot and a mess, with all the toppings piled high and dripping off in wonderful cheesiness, challenging you to get them in your mouth before they fall!  The burger itself is only mildly seasoned if at all.  Ingredients, including the bun, are all first quality and very fresh.

Five Guys fries are a mountain of potato goodness.  Even the regular size fries will feed you and a friend, maybe more.  Some not so good news - they're not my fave fries.  They are fresh cut and tasty with some skin on, but they are a wide cut and somewhat limp compared to the competition.  So they're good, but not great.

The staff here is very friendly, efficient and the store is clean.  I was approached three times during a recent visit to see how my food was and if I needed anything.  Heck, I don't get that good of service at some full serve places. 

California's In N Out still makes a better no-nonsense burger (make mine double double animal style), and their fries are crispier and tastier, too, but unless you find yourself magically whisked from Cleveland to LA, Five Guys Burgers are about as good as it gets in these parts for fast food burgers.  Expensive, but hey you're worth it...  Enjoy!"	Five Guys	17695 Bagley Rd	Middleburg Heights	OH	44130	24	1	American (New), Burgers, Restaurants, Fast Food	-81.8239072	41.3714793

This joint displays its testicular fortitude from the get-go.  Nastiness over the speaker, demanding that you call the sandwiches "McDoubles" now instead of Double Cheeseburgers.  Complete silence and a snarl when you pay.  Then, when you get to the food window, the employees show you what's up by screaming at each other for 15 minutes (with the little window open) while you sit helpless waiting for your food.  And don't dare divert your attention, because if you aren't ready when a bag comes flying out the window, you know that shit's hitting the ground.

They finish shoving the metaphorical thorny 12-inch dildo up your ass by giving you an order of cold rubbery fries prepared sometime during the Clinton administration that only half-way fill the little container, a Snack Wrap with extra lettuce when you ordered it without, and a smaller-than-wanted Coke that syrup forgot to enrich.

You'll really want to take all that shit back and return it, because you got just ripped off faster than the arms on a meathead's new t-shirt.  You know they might get things right the second time, but they'd be swapping that snack wrap lettuce for some nice, chunky phlegm, courtesy of the cooking staff.   

Don't ask for a refund, though.  You might get knifed."	McDonald's	1349 E Tallmadge Ave	Akron	OH	44310	8	1	Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food, Coffee & Tea, Food	-81.4659614	41.102459

Most times you go to Five Guys and your whole experience is great! You're usually greeted by smiling and happy faces and delicious food however it wasn't so Willy Wonka like at the Bagley Road Five Guys. Now I wasn't expecting a man in a tall top hat to come out walking with a cane and fall down into a somersault or anything nor did I expect to see little orange Oompa Loompas making my delicious burger and fries. I did however expect to see at least one happy face which was nowhere insight. The review lost a star because of the service itself. 

The highlight of it other than being with my best friend and sister was the delicious food. I have a gluten allergy and I love that they offer their delicious burgers without the bun although those buns are so delicious and I hate missing out. They are great at packaging it in a separate bag and even put your condiments and toppings separately too. The burger was cooked perfectly it was delicious! A delicious, juicy patty that wasn't pink but cooked perfect! I don't like a burger that can moo at me. The fries which was enough to feed a village were delicious! Seriously you can get a large and feed a table of 5! 

I like that they give you cups for free for water instead of having to purchase a bottle of water. I am hoping the employees aren't normally this down or depressing but the employees need to smile and get some personality like other Five Guys. The other locations I've been to they are singing and dancing something like Willy Wonka however this location was more like darker parts of a Tim Burton movie. However the food was 5/5."

You would have to drive 20 to 25 min to go to a different one. The problem with this place is it has one drive threw, & if there frappe machine is down your screwed because once your in line you cannot get out! ( unless you wanna jump a curb & go down a huge 90 degree angle hill?) The other day I had 4 cars in front of me, & 8 behind me, this was the 5th time in July that the frappe machine wasn't working. In June it was down the 4 times I went there to get a frappe...what I don't understand is why not get a new one??? Can't McDonald's afford a new machine? If any of the other fast food places would sell frappe's I would instantly switch. And yes I could go inside but the lines are just as long,sometimes longer! But what can you expect with only one cashier taking orders?? And this is at the busiest times. The inside of the place isn't very clean either, I watched as an employee wiped tray after tray with the same cloth not once changing clothes or even disinfecting the one she was using. Would you want your food put on those trays? I know I certainly do not.

First, I drove up to the drive thru and it was blocked with a delivery truck. The second lane was blocked as well with carts. I drove up to the first window and explained this to the woman who had a very nasty attitude. She asked if my purchace was going to be "exact cash or card". I thought this was weird, but I went with it. I ordered and my total was $13.48 I asked her if she had a $10 bill since I had a $20 and 3 ones. She said yes so I handed her $20.50 and told her to keep the 2 pennies. She struggled for a few minutes to give me back ten dollars and then finally opened the window to give me back my original $3 Bill's, a $5 bill, and another $2 bills ... Oh, and 2 pennies!!!!! She had exact change all along!! I drove to the next window to get my food. After leaving the window my son noticed one of his biscuits were missing. I got out of the car and went inside to get it. Another rude girl yelled to the back she needed said biscuit. I waited for another few minutes to get it. I got back in the car and started driving down the road. I asked my son for my sausage, egg and cheese mcmuffin. He gives it to me and as I unwrap it I was disgusted. Burnt!!! Very unsatisfied customer!!

I have been there before when a few times they were out of containers for the ketchup and you had to go back to the counter so they could give you packets.  Now it also seems that when you go inside the French Fries are not very hot but when I go thru the drive thru they are, go figure!

We ordered single with cheese burger meals while running holiday errands. Both burgers were literally COLD to the touch -- the buns felt like they had been refrigerated and the meat was cool. I turned around and went back and told them. They gave me a new burger at room temperature, or cooler. Huh??? We opened the burger within about 60 seconds of pulling away. Since we were rushing and hungry -- we stupidly ate our cold burgers. Later we both felt sick and made multiple trips to the bathroom. I'd stay away -- they clearly would be in violation of health codes six ways from Sunday had they been inspected today. That's just awful -- I always worry about folks who are ill or recovering from Chemo or something, or kids who are sick and their parents are trying to get them to eat anything they'll accept and then these lazy, careless owners and workers endanger them with poor food handling. We won't be back to this location.	Wendy's	34323 Center Ridge	N.Ridgeville	OH	44039	8	1	Fast Food, Restaurants, Burgers	-81.9959821	41.3978423

I chose a double croissanwich. I took a picture of it on my dashboard and uploaded to yelp. The croissant was somewhere between average and slightly better than average. The scrambled egg I thought was pretty good. The sausage wasn't marvelous as it seemed as if it was nuked. Which I think a lot of the BK menu is comprised of pre-cooked component pieces that are quickly nuked to give some heat to it. And bacon.. to me .. everything is better with bacon. This bacon was pretty crispy. I prefer mine just a little chewy. Tasty bacon ... but more crunchy than I'd like for a sandwich. 

Sooooo ... in general ... Not the way above average food I'm accustomed to. Not the worst. Somewhere around average. The price of this sandwich was more than normal for what I'd expect for a premium breakfast sandwich .. It wasn't as good as the price.

Five Guys Burgers and Fries is a chain burger joint.  

Their burgers are fresh, juicy, stacked any way you like them and they come hot off of the grill.  The staff works as a well oiled machine.  
Although we haven't had them, there are hot dogs on the menu.    I think they are Nathan's dogs.  

There is a board near the register that tells you where the potatoes are from.  Alot of articles and reviews posted all over the walls.  I haven't seen any newer dates on any of them so I'm wondering about that.  
This store is fairly clean and always busy.  It beats the burgers, price and taste of Red Robins around the corner and beats the flavor and meatiness of Sonic and Steak and Shake, located across the street and next door.  4 burger joints, only Five Guys tops them.

Many locations also lock their doors after 9 pm, preventing dining in. Most common reason given was 'not enough staff.' My evening business is going to gas station-convenience stores.

Well I got home and there's a hash brown with a sausage biscuit with mild sauce.. why would they give me a sausage biscuit with mild sauce? Not the brightest people working at this McDonalds. Also the food isn't even warm (I live less than 5 mins away from this Mcdonalds) and the hash brown is hard and not hot, which means it's been sitting out for a while. :( Just makes me sad and feel guilty when I spend money here especially after their prices went up a bit after years.

Only two cars ahead of me in the drive thru and no customers inside yet it took 35 minutes to get a two quarter pounders and a large fry. The order speaker was so low they could barely hear me and I could barely hear the employee. The employee at the window took 10 minutes to retake my order. I have no clue what confused her but the attitude wasn't necessary. Finally the manager came over and ran my debit card. I sat another 10 or so minutes before they handed me my food. When I got home the quarter pounders were cold as were the fries. I don't even want to think about how long it would have took if the place was even halfway busy. Yea, tear it down!

I go in, it is clean. I get in the short line and go to the register. I order the burger, they do not have it. I order the slushie, they do not have it. I end up ordering something because I am pretty hungry. To get my Iced tea, I had to get the ice and bring the cup back to the counter.  Okay, the food comes. I ask for a napkin, they do not have napkins!!! 
I asked the young woman why they were out of everything. SHe gave me a dirty look and said: "Don't blame us, it's not our fault." Wrong answer--"I'm sorry" would have worked and I told her so.

The facility was recently renovated and is clean. The parking lot is usually pretty dirty.
The real issue is the service. They never ever have any of the cold brew coffee options they advertise. It takes 10 minutes to get an iced coffee so weak it is unbelievable. They are always out of something; sugar, jelly, food items. It is pretty bad.

I dont eat fast food often but on the go.. it usually hits the spot. I love siracha and thought I would try the new burger..  so at the drive thru window-the speakers are awful.. the person taking my order was shouting and took a long time to place the order... no matter how clearly I spoke.. ok no big deal it happens..drove up to the window to pay and tell them about the speaker and how bad it is..and they could care less.. whatever.. ok then pull up for my food. I was told they just put in a fresh batch of fries and if I wouldn't mind pulling off to the side. nothing makes me more mad than have to pull aside for fast food.. after I paid and stuck but nothing you can do you already paid so here I am pulling aside. and I thought well least I'm getting fresh batch of fries.. and was able to catch up on some texts etc. then my food arrives.. delivered in person. 


 Ok looking at the Siracha burger... not impressed. that's a little bit smaller than a quarter pounder and not worth the money I spent which was nine dollars for a combo!! I had no idea how high in cost it would be I just wanted to try it. I could barely see the Siracha sauce on the bun ( see picture)  It was meh.. oh and the fries that were supposed to be a fresh batch were the worst I've ever had. They were bland and didn't taste like anything not even grease  Seriously!! They had to be the old batch of fries and not the fresh batch?  They were awful!

They really aren't awful for fast food, although I avoid their breakfasts and chili (why do so many people love it?). 

They make a capable burger, and as I said in my other Wendy's review, for a chain they at least strive for an interesting and diverse menu, even though they strike out a bit. 

 I mean, Dave Thomas seemed like a pretty sincere, stand-up, honest, decent, self-made guy with a wonderful backstory. He was a rarity in American business, the reason many people still buy into the Horatio Alger myth. 

BUT, this Lawrenceville location has terrible service. The people behind the counter lollygag, socialize, and almost defiantly take their time preparing your food, chatting with their elderly regulars. 

Again, I'm sure these people don't make enough money, but jeez. Are they just revolting against their corporate masters? Who knows? Do they just not like me? If so, they can get in line for that like I do at Wendy's...and wait...and wait...

I guess I'll just not come here anymore, and today was the first time in a while. Hey, I was craving a burger on my break. 

Fast food is sinful (in a bad way) anyway. Forgive me Xenios. 

Although, I did strike up a conversation with slight, ponytailed, seemingly intelligent fellow who claimed to had just finished a 20-hour shift! He looked like a bike messenger but was perhaps a medical resident? Who knows? Anyway, let's just say I helped (yelped?) get the word out about the excellent Deli On Butler just across the street and a block up.

So I was meant to come here today, to witness for good food.

The burgers and fresh cut fries are fantastic, but the kicker here is they are very attentive to her food allergy.  Because they don't use the fryer to fry anything w. gluten (chicken strips, onion rings etc), the french fries are gluten free.  Thats a huge win for anyone w. celiacs disease.  The staff changes their gloves when they handle her food, and even has a gluten free bun if she chooses to have it.  She also loves the soda machine, it has a million choices on it.

I would say this Five Guys is usually less busy overall than my standard Five Guys off Cedar, but the food prep is a little longer (although it still comes pretty quick). A small pet peeve I have with this place is the portion of fries they provide with a "small" order. Most Five Guys go overboard and give you more than the standard portion of fries. This Five Guys place varies between giving you the standard portion of fries sometimes, and other times they'll give you extra fries. I'm gracious when they give more fries on any occasion, but I just wish I knew how many fries they're going to give before I order. If I knew they were just going to give me the standard small portion of fries, I'd order a medium size to get the extra fries. But that's just me nitpicking, this is a recommendable Five Guys.

While out shopping with my mom one Saturday afternoon (ladies - we all know how exhausting and famishing a good shopping trip can be!) we decided to refuel at Five Guys.  Now, I have had their burgers before, but they were always when my mom would pick them up on the way home from work and let me tell you - you definitely want to order in and eat this bad boy right away because it tastes OH SO MUCH better!

Ordering is easy - pick your size (the regular sizes are HUGE - was enough for two meals for me), your toppings (whatever your little heart desires), and fries (don't be shocked when you see just how big the regular size is!).  Pay (the prices are great), then make your way over to the condiments section and grab as many napkins as humanly possible because you'll need them!  After a few minute wait, your order is up and now you can get ready to dig in!  What a treat for your taste buds - by far one of the best burgers I've laid my hands on (Yes - even better than many of the gourmet ones I've had).  You get A TON of food for the price and all of it tastes like a million bucks!"

The food is good, and most of the time I don't encounter any problems with my order. The thing I hate, though, is that I need to plan ahead and make sure I have a book or periodical with me when i go because the service is glacially slow. Seriously, the service at this place makes the process in which organic matter turns into oil look rapid. I have waited over 10 minutes for an order at 8:00 PM...and the staff is very rarely apologetic about the fact that one could kill a cow, obtain the meat, grind it into hamburger, and cook it in less time than it takes to cook a pre-made hamburger and fry up some fries. Honestly, it's so bad that I prefer to drive 15 minutes one way to get good service at the McDonald's on Mayfield in South Euclid.

The more you pile on, the bun will fall apart and toppings end up everywhere.  Fries are always overflowing in the bag.  Large is definitely a large.  Cajun fries are spicy but it's up to your taste.  They do have open peanuts as a snack and they do cook with refined peanut oil so if you or someone has a serious peanut allergy be careful.

Went and filled up my drink. I threw my receipt away with the drink straw wrapper. Received my food and left. checked the bag in the car and they forgot my friends sandwich that i was getting for him. went back in to say something. have had this happen before and they always just give you what they forgot. This day the cashier decided to argue with me about what i ordered. she tried to say that i was just trying to get free food. she basically said she wasnt going to give me anything without a receipt. Im not one to argue and bought another sandwich. of course like 5 dollars bc it was a meal deal. disappointing visit to say the least.

I gave this McDonald's not one, not two, but six visits and each time I was disappointed. They are not a friendly bunch, and it's hit or miss on whether you get what you ordered. Today's visit was a wrap for me with this location. They are horrible. Went through the drive thru, ordered one 2 for $5 deal and one 6pc nugget meal with gogurt chosen for one of the sides. They had no coke products available. I'm one to usually check my food before I drive off however there were so many cars behind me that I opened the bags, glanced over everything and left. Got home and found no issues with the 2 for $5 items. Looked inside the happy meal box and saw that there were nuggets, a huge toy, sauce.......and that's it. NO FRIES, NO GOGURT.

Every time I come to this specific McDonalds they ALWAYS mess it up or something is a huge production with the workers. Let me bring up two specific incidents that specifically stand out.

About a month ago I went with my parents after a long day at the doctors for a quick lunch and my Dad ordered a chocolate milkshake and low and behold the girl says "our ice cream machine is broke". Seriously how are their machines ALWAYS broke? Go to McDonalds and that is like a broken record. At the window my Dad says to the girl hey make sure you get the machine fixed it's been broke for weeks. As the girl closed the window we could hear her make some strange grunting noise and yell "Ohhh my Godddd" like a whiny teenager. That wasn't very professional however when you have kids running the window and these restaurants what more could you expect? They had us pull up and wait for our food and a manager brought it out and in her hand was a chocolate milkshake. Holy chalupas the milkshake Gods must've "fixed" the machine within 2 minutes. They deserve a medal for fastest machine fixers. It was amazing. The manager was very kind and went above and beyond! Thank you for your service I wish I could remember her name.

Last time which was last weekend I went back after my Pups vet visit and we got lunch. I ordered a dish of vanilla ice cream in a dish for my pup. The girl put it on a cone and when we said no it's supposed to be in a dish they take the ice cream on a cone and just throw it in a soda cup with a lid ‍ They also forgot the drink from the Happy Meal, BBQ Sauce, Extra Sauce for 2 burgers and fries. How can one place screw up ALL OF THE TIME? Seriously if young teens can't do a correct job while working then why are they working?

The fries, arguably the most important part of any fast food place that actually sells fries, are neither crispy on the outside nor fluffy on the inside, and these fries were *just* fried.

Pulled up to drive thru window and ordered 4 plain double cheese burgers with mayo on side.  She got confused so i repeated then she repeated plain to me but didn't ring it as plain and without knowing that was my whole order she is telling me the total and rushing me to the window.  At which point i was pretty sure they were going to be made wrong so at window i repeated they are plain right?  She gave me the dirtiest look and said i didn't say plain.  I hope they record everything cause im just completely astounded.  I would have left right then but she already took and swiped my card so i couldn't just say forget it.

The girl who waited on us today really was having a tough time being competent enough to even take a $2.13 order. She didn't ring us up right anyways.. Ordered two coffees asked how many cream and sugars and then proceeds to hand us two large plastic coke cups. We had to ask again for coffee. She looked at us like we were crazy. She asked again how many cream and sugars we told her. Absolutely no sugar in it... And one might as well of been black.  Lord help us if we wanted food. She put her entire hand inside one of the plastic cups and then put it back on the holder.	McDonald's	547 Broad St	Elyria	OH	44035	3	0	Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food	-82.1088214	41.3680907

Sometimes it's just convenient to hit the drive thru in order to save time and grab something on the go. So I'm not without some credibility here.  That said, I think this location is near the BOTTOM of all Wendy's I've tried over the years. Bottom. Why? Well, despite that it's in a premium location, the service, convenience, and food quality are subpar. The drive thru is flat out dangerous. Not just with Waterworks Mall traffic coming in and out but the drive thru window is jammed in the corner of a tight, very crowded parking lot making placing your order a challenge. 

Worse still is the pay station on the next corner and an incredibly tight turn to the pickup window. I'm sure a lot of people have scraped the crap out of their cars just navigating the turn. Wouldn't that just tick you off knowing you cost yourself hundreds of dollars in body shop repair by getting a $.99 burger? Whoa! And if that wasn't bad enough, the food has been cold at times. Wendy's? Cold food? What's going on???? Yep, cold nuggets, cold burger, cold chicken sandwich - or at the very least, luke warm.  It's decent when it's hot -  but I can assure you that cold takes it down quite a few notches. Try to avoid this location. I do."

Sadly this place was open but only the drive through was open.  The inside of the restaurant visibly was going through some sort of remodeling and modernization renovation.  That would have been great if it was done but the doors were locked.  I really didn't want to take it to go or eat in my car so I left.  Being open is great, but only for the drive through?

So this particular restaurant has its ups and downs. The drive through is really slow though, which is why I had to knock one star down. Even if there is nobody in line, they take forever to get your food out to you. And the sad thing is, it's usually cold and dry when you get it. 

The inside is usually very sticky and not clean. I will not lie, I don't like going inside very much. I've done it maybe twice since I've been here. 

And lastly, the service isn't the best. I've had some really rude employees but I've also had some nice ones. The managers are usually rude to you but I can't blame them - they are right across from a middle school so they have to run a tight ship.

We arrived and pulled into the drive-thru at 9:23PM. We got to the order screen around 9:31PM. I proceeded to start my order with 2 of the $1.99 Kids meals after 4PM. But instead I was told that the price is only good until 9PM. I told the drive-thru girl that there is no end time listed on the promo as I was looking at it right on the menu board. She proceeded to tell me that the "PEOPLE" told her I'm not allowed to get the discount. I asked what people she was referring to and was met with silence. We decided to just drive around and go in as she didn't know what she was talking about.

We entered the store at 9:33PM and went to the register. I again started my order with the $1.99 kids meals. To my surprise the cashier had no issue applying the discount. We ordered around $30 worth of food and stepped to the side to await our order. This is where it became troublesome. We kept waiting and waiting. And more guests came in and ordered. And then they were waiting as well. After 15 minutes one guest  went back up and requested a refund as they had to get going. The manager took her time getting to the front to refund the guest. No apology was offered to him at any point. Meanwhile we are still waiting. Half of the employees are standing around in the back doing nothing. One of them asked what was still
being waited on. Another quiped back with "Everything" as he laughed.

It took over 30 minutes to complete our order by which time almost all the food was cold and the custom order was incorrect. The iced tea that we ordered was not fresh as well. Following the same standard no apology was offered and no reason was given for the lack of efficiency. This is not the first time that I have noticed this issue.

We stopped for some food on the way home. It was way too late to make dinner at home. We figured that using the drive thru would be the quickest and easiest with a cranky kid in the backseat. We noticed a few employees outside on a smoke break. At this time, we pulled up to the speaker.. no one greeted us. It was silent. So we waited.. then continued to wait.. the smokers went inside at this moment. Finally, a few minutes later.. someone came on the speaker.. we were immediately told to "hold on". No welcome, no please or thank you. Just "hold on".. so we waited.. and waited.. and waited some more. We almost pulled away.

She finally came back on the speaker. Asked for our order, we confirmed the total and we pulled up to pay. You could tell that I was going to get a side of attitude with my order. She ran our card and handed over our drinks. There was a minor wait on the food - no big deal. Our food finally came and she says "here ya go!". Didn't say anything else. We pulled away and headed home.

Once we got home, we opened everything and started eating. In on of the whoppers, we found a hair. So it got tossed. Along with whatever remaining food everyone else had. A few hours later, two of us got sick. Started with a tummy ache and then progressed into throwing up.. needless to say, we won't be returning to this location.

Dirty parking lot, tables, floors, incorrect orders,  slow service, noisy crew and patrons---what' s not to love? The cashier who served me was nice, but if your order is wrong, she will challenge you instead of apologizing, making it right, and moving on. She's in it to win it.

I was in two weeks ago. Stupidly, I ate my meal inside (asking for table to be cleaned, which they did, immediately). The GM came over, asked if I minded if he could talk a minute. Of course, I agreed; he sat down (!).

He asked me if I was the one who did a survey, and commented on the noisy patrons (specifically older). I looked him in the eye and said yes. He told me it  lowered his store's score,  and he had no intention of asking the noisy patrons to leave. I said I didn't want them to leave, just not shout (across the store) and swear. I realize that some can't hear well, and talk very loudly. Most just don't care. They take over the whole place. There is no escaping them, no matter where you sit. He did, however, say he would ask them to leave if they were using profanity. He also said he's the only one that sees the comments. I told him I appreciated him explaining, in detail, how the surveys affect his store. I said to summarize,  you want me to knock it off on the surveys. He 
said yes. This talk took my entire meal, which, honestly, I preferred to eat alone. I left as soon as he was done. I feel his behavior was tacky and unprofessional.  I bet he didn't and wouldn't, have a talk with the obnoxiously boisterous patrons that cuss. 

That was my last visit. I wish him well."	McDonald's	3023 Washington Pike	Bridgeville	PA	15017	28	1	Restaurants, Fast Food, Burgers, Food, Coffee & Tea	-80.1145833	40.3537208

It's very disheartening as this location used to be one of the best.  Clearly management has changed and they are very understaffed and desperate for anyone with common sense and a little work integrity to work at this location.   Every tome I go through the drive through, does not matter what time of day- it's always a 15-20 minute process.  This location as lost me as a customer.  It would be quicker for me to go to another McDonald's than wait in that horrifically slow drive through.

When it comes to a typical fast food joint, I don't typically write a review unless it was a really terrible experience and/or meal. I woke up this morning groggy as all hell. I just wanted a frappe and a hash brown to perk myself up. My boyfriend came along and got some food too. The drive through was super packed, so we just parked and went inside, we assumed it would be quicker. I got my frappe and hash brown, my boyfriend got a Big Mac meal and two mcchickens (he's a big guy). Our food took a solid 15 minutes before it was ready to go (we ordered our food to go). My boyfriend said the Big Mac was so dry that he needed to take a drink of his coke after each bite. The fries and mcchickens were good however, he said. The thing that probably annoyed me the most was that as soon as you walk in, there's employees and people standing in the doorway, preventing anyone from being able to walk through the door without asking everyone to move. There wasn't even anyone in line, just a bunch of people standing around (mostly employees) and being so loud. Not to mention there were two small children that were under 3 years old running around the entire restaurant, including the back kitchen! This was the most infuriating because that's totally dangerous! The kids were pretty obviously one of the employees because 3 of the employees kept picking up these kids, attempting to keep them from going in the back. I'm seriously appalled by all this. Under no circumstances should an employee have to babysit their child while at work, especially when you work at a fast food place. Just take the day off? What would happen if one of the kids wandered all the way in the back and touched the grill, or got burnt from fryer oil? Why if an employee was transporting hot food and didn't see one of these kids coming and tripped over one of them and everyone got hurt? Unbelievable! I do not think I will be returning to this McDonald's again! Food was just okay, staff was a mess, and almost all of the tables looked filthy! Cmon McDonald's you're better than this.

It was  a very minor incident  but was blown out , Here's what happened , there was a sign next to the order board that stated Cup or Cone for .75. Both the Manager and Cashier could  only repeat what a Advertising Promotion stated , meaning Even as I explained to them that there was a Sign next to the order board that was lit up he tried to convince Me otherwise.  Now get this , I stated that they need to honor the price which was a difference of .25, cashier still said 2.00. Now I'm on principle of the matter now, after driving back around showing the Manager the sign all I get was , You're right.  He found a sign in the dark that you couldn't even notice to try to prove his point.    I won't go back but if you do  insist that they should honor all posted Promotions.    Just crazy!!

I have dined with the King many a time across this fine land.  I have watched their slow decline with sadness over the last thirty years.  At one point, they actually challenged the Clown for burger superiority, but now, they're a weak shadow on the market, barely a player...

...and the BK at this location is a perfect example of why.

EVERYTHING at this BK takes ten minutes.  Doesn't matter what you order, be prepared to wait.

It's always dirty.  When I was a kid and worked at the Clown, we were always cleaning.  There was usually one or two people on any shift whose sole job was to keep the lobby clean.  This place is a hole.

Why does the food taste weird?  If I want BK, I actually make the drive to Deforest, rather than eat at this location, which is actually a stone's throw from my house.  The food here tastes bad, bleachy, and wrong.  What are they doing to the food?

I ate there once a year ago, and the fries were old and cold, and tasted like an entire bag of salt was dumped on them. The burger was bland, except for the taste of salt. Even in a small town (Sun Prairie), the parking lot somehow manages to get swamped with diesel fumes--must be the wind blowing off Highway 151.

I decided to try it again today, wondering if it was just a random bad experience. No. They made fresh fries, and so I didn't mind waiting 15 minutes at the window. The guy behind me in the drive through looked like he minded. I had the opportunity during the extended wait to notice that all of the cars behind me were driven by the truly obese--with fat billowing out of their shirts, with faces that became chins that became torsos, without a clear definition of where one stopped, and the next began--extreme, even for Wisconsin.

The fries were fresh, and salty to the point that my gums hurt. The burger completely fell apart, and was bland, except for the overwhelming taste of salt. The bread was stale. I guess that was a second flavor, that I could taste through the salt. So the Whopper tasted like salty, stale bread, which disintegrated, somehow appropriately.

I found the Sun Prairie one just as bad. Why is it so difficult to apply the condiments so the cover the burger rather than just one edge of it? Those things are thrown together and when you try to eat it, you find nothing is even close to the center. I've been going to BK's for many years. I just visited one in southern Illinois that was wonderful. Why are the ones in the Madison area so horrible? I guess it boils down to lousy managers.

You aren't going to get a gourmet meal. What you do get is OK food quicky at an OK price, quickly. This McDs just can't seem to hit any aspect of the service side. We sat in the drive thru waiting our turn for nearly 10 minutes. It's a double lane, so there were 4 cars in front of us when you count both lanes. Then it's our turn. Except the lane next to us keeps having their orders taken. Two more cars get in front of us. Still haven't taken our order. We finally backed up and left. Will never go here again. We should know better. The last time we stopped here theye couldn't get it right either. Too many other options to put up with crap service. Won't bother again.

Glad I ate in as the sandwich desperately needed salt and pepper.
Also, the hashbrowns tasted weird. I don't know how to describe it, but it wasn't like usual. I wound up throwing them away. The only positive note food wise, was That they had the new soda machine that has all the different flavors.

We ordered two grilled chicken go-wraps, along with beverages. My wrap was fine, but the one in the kid's meals was totally unacceptable! The tortilla shell was dripping wet and appeared to have been dropped in a puddle of water! I was appalled that they would give something of this quality to a child!

This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she'd be with me in, "just a second." Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves. When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept. Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong. At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end. But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait. If you value your ability to eat at Burger King more than your time, I would suggest staying in your car at this location and living in blissful ignorance.

After calling the Wendys and being redirected multiple times eventually leading to the corporate phone number, we left a complaint. They called back with not an apology, but with the words "Claim Denied". After continuing to visit the Wendys as it is the only convenient location for us, they continue to screw up orders with the most recent one being forgetting dressing and croutons for a Cesar salad, leaving just lettuce. Also asked for hot sauce for my chili and just after asking I got the food to find that there's no hot sauce.

Some excerpts: "This is the slowest, most poorly run McDonald's I have ever been to."  "Unbelievable." "I've been waiting 25 minutes for a Jalapeno McDouble."
The inside is actually really nice.  They have a faux fireplace with a mantle and all the Pier One trimmings, but the service was horrendous.  I ordered 6 nuggets and a medium fry and it took them half an hour to get the things out.  The food was fine but 30 minutes?  We might as well have gone to a sit down joint.  As we were leaving, I realized the issue.  The manager looks to be a 15 year old who is hanging out with his bros instead of managing the location.  Some employee arrived for work and the whole front of house staff, manager included, were slapping hands and shooting the spit right there behind the counter.  Never again; especially not when there are so many other options right in that are - not to mention a multitude of McDonald's franchises within less than 10 miles.

Took it back and asked the manager for a refund which after about 5 mintues of going back and forth he agreed to give it to me. Even when presented with the raw burger/reciept he still tried to argue the point that it was not their fault and they would gladly give me another meal. I sure did want to keep eating their raw burgers after the first one, he must be delusional. I will be contacting the Wisconsin health department and I encourage others to as well.

There were at least three cars waiting behind me too! I finally got the attention of the lady inside to see what the problem was, and I was just told that they are "short staffed" and they make the food fresh to order, Which I guess means they go out back and wait for the chickens to mature, slaughter them, and THEN make the nuggets! I asked for a manager, when she finally showed up, I was not given an apology, just the same story of being short staffed. At this point I had asked to just have my money back so that I could go elsewhere (still no food) and I was told by said manager that she doesn't know how to do that....so I waited....and finally (28 minutes later) got my food, which was cold, and my milkshake had long since melted. Waste of my time and money!

I'm a sucker for cheap nuggets so I frequent this BK a few times a month while at work ......maybe more than I should but tats another story.  

 Lets start with for the most part everything is fine, I mean lets be realistic, its 10 nuggets for a buck 49 we're not talking "life Styles of The Rich and Famous " here !!   Sometimes the nuggets might be a bit cool but they do have you in and out pretty fast at lunch and that's important because I want to be back to work making my boss proud of me ASAP.   

Now for what REALLY prompted me to risk carpel tunnel, the PARKING LOT LINES !! 

WHO was the genius who thought it would be "better" to make the lines straight as opposed to the way they "used" to be for years !! ??   ITS COMPLETELY STUPID !!    The parking spots that run to the right as you pull in are perpendicular to the building, they used to be at about 30 degs that made it real simple to pull in and back out ...but NOW,  its like Austin Powers in the hallway trying to move around in the parking lot .  When you drive thru, look at the cars they are not in the lines and most are slightly skewed because you CAN't turn your car 90 degs in the driveway space !!   Another thing, someone is FOR SURE going to get backed into because the drive thru backs up at peak hrs so you know someone is going to get in their car get all situated then someone will pull in behind them in the drive thru and get backed into, its going to happen.

I'll start off by saying I never once in my life filed a complaint on someone. I know how it goes, I worked for a restaurant before. Managers themselves get tired of customers just being a pain in the rear for any reason. Don't want their job to become harder. Basically they just don't want problems. I remember many times laughing with managers about how some customers were & complained. Even when one of us workers deserved to be complained on for something we done or said..... This evening(5/20/19 at 6:55pm) I was just completely stunned. All I did was show the brunette
Girl that was running drive through my app code for $2 off a premium combo & that was the end of the world for her. Huffing & puffing rolling her eyes. I was at the drive thru window for like 90 seconds. As she was gathering things up just kept acting like a you know what looking at me. I was in a good mood. Can only imagine if I wasn't. The whole time I acted normal like nothing was wrong. At then end she like tossed & dropped the bag in my hand. I was inches away from just throwing that bag in her face & just driving away. I just said wow & drove away. On top of all that bs she didn't give me my frosty sundae that I assumed was in the bag. Maybe I should of been the one acting like an Ahole. Back to my point above. Waste of time bringing it up & not turning around for a $2 frosty. All I have to say is it's good for everyone including me I wasn't in a bad mood when this happened because I'd probably be sitting In the back of a cop car right about now. Was just grabbing dinner before hitting the interstate to drive home. Glad I don't live in that area because Wendy's is the only fast food I like. I can't be the only one this happened to tonight.

I was in the drive thru by 3:30pm and waiting about a minute before getting helped.  There was already one car at the payment/food window and another car parked in the lot.  By the time I actually got service, 3 cars had pulled in behind me and waiting.  My order included burgers, chicken nuggets and multiple side items.  My receipt says that the order was completed at 3:32 but my order was not given to me until 3:46.  In fact, the car directly behind me left without taking their order.  When I checked my order, I was missing half of the nuggets I had ordered.  I went inside with my receipt and was told that I would have to wait another 4 minutes while more nuggets were fried.  While I was waiting, another patron walked into the store and was very irate.  She scolded the staff as this was the 2nd time in 20 minutes that she had driven back to the restaurant to fix a burger order.  When my nuggets were ready, it was placed in the counter and before I could ask for a bag, the staff disappeared and I had to juggle 4 small bags of chicken nuggets to the car without a paper baggie.  By this time, it was 4:05 and in counting my nuggets, I was shorted 6 nuggets from 4 packs and everything else was cold.  I wish they would work towards better customer relations and strive towards doing WELL for the sake of good service rather than sluggishly doing a job because they have to.

Went through the drive thru with my wife on a Wednesday evening around 6:15.  Ordered a taco, crispy chicken Caesar sandwich, and a Whopper Junior meal.  We had to go to a soccer game so we didn't eat right away, but did verify that we received all of the ordered items.

After arriving at our destination 20 minutes later, my wife took a bite of her chicken sandwich only to find that IT WAS RAW ON THE INSIDE.  Absolutely disgusting that a place can screw up a chicken sandwich this badly.  We resolved to return to the restaurant after the game to pursue a refund.

When we arrived back at the restaurant, around 9:30, we went inside to show the manager the raw chicken and the receipt in order to get a refund.  The manager said he couldn't pull up the receipt and that all he could do was give us another sandwich.  By now it was well past dinner time so all we wanted was a refund and to go on our way.  But he insisted that all he could do was replace the sandwich.  My wife said that this was ridiculous, and the manager actually replied "and so are you" while opening the register and getting my money.

This place needs to be shut down and the manager needs to be out of a job.  I called the national Burger King Guest Relations number and reported the entire incident, and am hopeful that they will take appropriate action."

Tonight was one of those nights where we didn't feel like cooking, so my mom and I decided to go to this location (Dad chose Arby's, which, honestly, was smart!). Ugh, big mistake on our part. As we sat down at home to eat, my mom took a bite of her burger, and it was raw inside. Gross. My chicken sandwich (grilled) was super salty. At first I thought it was the ranch sauce on it, so I took just a piece off to taste, and no, it was the chicken. It tasted like someone dumped a whole container of salt on it. Yuck. We're not expecting gourmet food, obviously, I mean, it's Wendy's... but I really don't think expecting a done hamburger and a not-so-salty chicken sandwich is much to ask for. BUT THIS ISN'T THE END...my mom called the store and asked to speak to the manager, not to complain or ask for money back or try to get free food, but to make them aware of the situation. The manager proceeded to get an attitude with her, tell her he "didn't have time for this", and hung up. They claim they're not a corporate store, but we will make sure corporate knows how nasty this location is, and how rude the manager is. Great way to run a business, guys (sarcasm).

With the exception of the morning/lunch crew, the employees are horrible.  My fiance and me went through drive-thru and two separate ladies at the window managed to not say one word to us. They took our money, gave us change, gave us the food and slammed the window in our faces. The whole time my fiance was saying thank you and they just ignored him.

The worst part is the laziness.  Ok, so they're too lazy to talk to their customers, so why would I think their food would be any different.  The past two times I went to this location to get a hot fudge sundae the cup was only filled half way.  Now we already know that these things are tiny, so basically they were too lazy to continue to hold down the lever that releases the ice cream...twice! Seriously?

As far as the speed of drive-thru is concerned, forget about it. Just go home, cook some shake and bake, and you'll have better food quicker.  Recently I went through drive-thru to order 4 sundaes (ok my family loves sundaes).  From the time we ordered to the time we got the sundaes (no one else in line) took 10 minutes. At first we were surprised at how long it was taking until we realized what the hold up was.  The employee who was supposed to be getting our ice cream was eating a Fish-O-Filet and making herself a fancy coffee (one of those latte's or something).  Once she finished making her drink, took a couple of sips, and finished her Fish-O-Filet, then she was able to help us.  I'm telling you, this place is just horrible.  I have to blame management.  I mean seriously, they need to pay attention to their employees and do some disciplinary action.  I've worked at McDonald's before, and the management I was under would have never let this occur."

I went to the drive thru and waited at the order speaker for several minutes. Finally I went inside, and had to wait even longer because they decided it was time to prioritize the drive thru over the customers inside the reataurant.
When I finally got someone to take my order they were spacey. I don't mean distracted, but as if they'd smoked their entire supply of weed and downed several doses of LSD before coming to work. I barely got my order through and recieved my number.
Sat down for a while waiting to be called. Eventually the manager realized I'd been forgotten about and she pushed to get my order ready.
As for the food, in addition to my roommate's chicken tenders I ordered myself a bbq chicken sandwich. The tenders looked like they'd been shat out by a dog -- but it's fast food, it doesnt have to look pretty.
The sandwich, however, might as well been a build-your-own box. Toppings were everywherr except on the sandwich, the bottom of the bun was smothered with barbeque sauce instead of having any on the meat, the chicken breast was half off the bread (pretty sure it only made it that far on because the box wasn't big enough for it to be anywhere else), and the top of the bun was smooshed to the top of the box.
I've heard this was the worst McDonald's in the city, but holy hell. I was not expecting this. If this level of competence is standard, then I understand why corporate is switching over to kiosks for orders.
Those were broken as well, by the way.

We then looked at the menu sign and i said #8 as asking for an orginal clearly was not being understood by this so called manager and added only the sandwich as we dudnt want fries. When we got the sanwiches i noted that they were with only cheese, no lettuce or mayo. So my mom went back to ask for lettuce and mayo and two nice gentleman in the back were going to do so and this Mac came rushing out of his office shouting at my mom saying that they not be doing so as this was what we had ordered.

Got our cups to get the drinks and there was no ice and also there was no catsup in the dispenser.  I told the person behind the counter and he didn't seem to be in any hurry to fill the ice dispenser.  Still waiting on our food, I asked the girl working behind the counter how much longer on our food.  All she said was I don't know.  Not helpful at all.  Finally the guy behind the counter got us ice from the drive through. It seemed the two employees seem not be care at all.

POTENTIAL HEALTH HAZARD!

Was very wary of this Wendy's due to the other reviews on Yelp, but was extremely craving fried chicken. Because of this I ordered the most basic food possible, 2 spicy chicken sandwiches. 

The wait was approximately 10 minutes. During this wait its easy to hear the people in the back yelling at each other about the mistakes they had made on their orders. When my order arrived, I looked into the bag to see only one chicken sandwich- wasn't wrapped correctly I must add- and a receipt for a DIFFERENT ORDER. There were so many incorrect orders that I had to wait back in line with other customers with incorrect orders to get such orders fixed. When it was my turn, the lady working the register was very rude about fixing the order because of the incorrect receipt that they gave me. Took another 10 minutes for them to produced a second chicken sandwich.
 
During my 20+ minute wait, I inspected the environment of the restaurant: the floors were EXTREMELY sticky, and that the counter-tops were very dirty. Dirty enough that I would say that it could breaching HEALTH VIOLATIONS."	Wendy's	26650 Lorain Rd	N.Olmsted	OH	44070	12	1	Fast Food, Burgers, Hot Dogs, Restaurants	-81.9177204	41.4186553

Yesterday I witnessed an employee being incredibly rude to another customer.  the customer had ordered 3 double cheeseburgers and they made 2.5 of them and needed to get some more patties or something - two of the burgers went under the heat lamp but the last one, half made sat on the prep table.  the customer asked and was told that the prep table was also 180 degrees just like other two burgers were under, even though the employee making the burgers was now leaning on it... so he as either burning his forearm or just spreading germs all over the prep table.

Turns out the employee being super rude was the manager - totally doesn't know his job, doesn't care about customer service and their tables should be disinfected.

I did not use the drive through. 
All I wanted was a salad. But I ended up leaving with a refund and no food.  I went in to this place and it seemed clean and no problems.  Well as I was waiting I happen to notice the lady with short red hair being very unclean.  She had gloves on. Which was awesome except for the following. She touched the headset she had on multiple times to readjust it.  She scratched her side.  She rubbed her nose. She touched the trash can. All while not changing her gloves afterwards.  She took the spoon that was in ketchup and banged the spoon against the trash to get rid of whatever was on the spoon. And put it back in the ketchup.  WTF!!!!  Who does that.  It touched the trash.  Change your gloves.  Toss spoon in sink.  Wash it.  I am completely disgusted by this place. 
The manager on duty had very bad dandruff.  As he was giving me my money back. He bent over to get the money. And the dandruff in his hair was nasty. Wash your hair with head and shoulders dude. 
I'm not happy.  I'm waiting on a response from the gm of the store.  Highly doubtful I'll receive the phone call. But go figure.

As others have stated, this place is beyond dirty: the floors, bathrooms, and employees. The employee (a male) who took our order had weeks worth of food covering his shirt. He was rude and haphazard in appearance. We ordered two whoppers and some french fries. The only redeeming quality about the food was at least the fries were fresh. However, the whoppers were cold. We took them back up and told the crew that the whoppers were cold. They prepared "new" ones and then, to my astonishment, asked me if I wanted them put in the microwave! What?!

After today,  I will be passing it by.  It has never been a surprise when I find out that something is missing from my order.  I wised up and started checking before I left the lot.  That hasn't been working out lately.  I hated checking my bags while still at the window because there's always cars behind me and I hated to make them wait.  I will advise anyone who uses the drive thru to check your order before pulling away.  My last three visits, I had to park my car and go inside and wait in line.  All three times, they held up different items that were left behind at the drive thru window until they held up the item I was missing.  They were rude and unapologetic.  This time, I talked to the manager who just shrugged his shoulders and said "Oh well,. sorry".  I looked at the worker next to him who was wearing a white dress shirt and dress pants and he just stared at me and said nothing.  Now I feel angry, frustrated AND my food is cold.   I think I'll take a detour the next time I bring food home for my family.  After all, you can see Wendy's from their parking lot.

The staff do not attempt to move faster. They will ignore size choices and automatically make meals large. They also get very upset when you went to use the phone app to pay or for coupons. When they are not busy they are very snarky about fixing mistakes they make. Several staff members do not wash their hands after using the bathroom, instead they use sanitizer that's clipped on to their belt.

And then there's the yearly Big Mac, though not necessarily from this location, and they aren't as good as they used to be.  One thing I don't understand is if this particular McDonald's is so bad, as stated by the chick who felt the need to use the "F" word numerous times, why on earth would you be so stupid as to keep going there???  Hello........there's another one right down the street.  I thought this was a site for normal people to express their opinions in a civilized way, and not a place for ignorant gutter-mouthed trash.

The burger: always cooked well done, but still juicy. Pick as many toppings as you want, but don't miss the grilled onions and mushrooms. Very flavorful, always satisfying.

The fries: #3 fries in Cleveland, behind Lola and Bar Cento (which is good company!). Idaho potatoes cut and fried right on site. Somewhere between shoestrings and chips in width, these are fantastic. Just crispy enough, and vinegar is available for those who really know how to enjoy a fry.

While I have never had them, there are also hot dogs, grilled cheeses, and a veggie sandwich (not a veggie burger - a veggie sandwich). 

A few things for the first-timer: A "cheeseburger" is really a double cheeseburger - ordering a  "Little Cheeseburger" is probably what you're expecting when you order the former. (No one is going to go hungry on a little burger!) The same goes with french fries - two people can easily share a regular fry. I repeat: two people can easily share a regular fry. The only reason to order a large fry is to server 3-4 people.

Without the information above, one could easily conclude that Five Guys is overpriced by ordering (for two people) two "cheeseburgers" and two "regular fries." This will get you enough food for four people, and will set you back $24. The key to recession friendly-eating at Five Guys is splitting - get a cheeseburger (which is a double!) and a regular fry. Between the satisfying stack of toppings on the burger, the big bag of fries and all-you-can-eat shell-your-own peanuts, you'll do just fine. Between this menu confusion and the lack of a veggie burger (or organic/grass-fed/free-range/douche-bag patties), I'm setting them back a star. 

For the legal team: Everything is gluten free (except the bun), there is no trans fat, they use peanut oil for the fries, Five Guys may be addicting."	Five Guys	36050-A Detroit Rd, Ste A	Avon	OH	44011	22	1	American (New), Fast Food, Restaurants, Burgers	-82.0222323	41.4603921

Simple right?  WRONG. I had to go back to the counter 4 times.  First, there were no large lids for my tea. Second, they gave sweet and sour sauce instead of BBQ. Third, they gave me "toddler" size socks for my 7 year old. Fourth, the kids meal was missing apples.  The manager on duty acted like she would rather be ANYWHERE but helping people.  When I tried to exchange the socks they didnt even have any other size.  When I went to ask for a lid the manager simply turned and asked another person to fill the lids????  JUST GIVE ME A DAMN LID FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER!!!  WHY SHOULD I WAIT FOR YOUR INCOMPETENT MANAGERIAL SKILLS?

The food really depends on how they're feeling that day BUT every single time I go something is wrong. Rather that be me missing a straw, getting cold fries, a burger that's been sitting for hours(I can tell because I know my food), they never seem to get things quite right in there. Customer service is horrible. They have an attitude where it's almost as if we, as the customers, ruined their day by coming. Sometimes it takes forever to get to the pay window and it takes them almost 10 minutes for a simple burger and fries. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

Stupid me, I didn't check the bag before leaving the window.  When I got home, there were LESS fries in the large fries that I ordered than the medium fries that came with the meal.

I think my days dealing with McDonald's are over.  I recently ordered a sausage & egg biscuit for breakfast (thankfully I had a BOG coupon).

Tons of toppings to choose from at no extra cost. The fries are really good and the amount of fries that you get is great! The reason for 4 stars is the pricing.

Inside is clean and somewhat quiet.  There is a television within the dining area, but it seems to be on mute the whole time.  

The need to work on better training for the staff which leads to ignoring the customers.  The gentleman behind the register took forever and struggled with the menu screen.

Today we used replacement meal cards that they sent us for consistently messing up our order. We ordered a 10 piece nugget meal, and my wife a 6 piece selects meal. Simple order right? At most 5 mins of frying and put items in a bag. They pulled her up and she waited 20 mins before going inside to see our orders was sitting on the counter. Gets home with the food, she gets a fresh 3 piece of chicken selects, we both get calico orders of a hot/cold fry mixture, but the biggest problem is that they pulled up the chicken nuggets at least a minute early. You can tell that they just came out of the fryer, but the breading was very light, with a doughy like texture, and the centers were ice cold. I took 1 bite and wanted to vomit. DO NOT GO HERE AFTER LUNCH, unless you want slow service, horrid food with a chance at getting salmonella, and a piss poor customer service attitude. This is not an isolated incident! And has been going on for years. The only reason that I keep trying is the prices and how close it is. Heck some nights they'll be open and won't even answer the drive thru speaker. Some machine is always broke, never a smile or a Thank You, just an all around horrible place for dinner, or a late night snack! Until they fix it (been near a decade) STAY FAR, FAR, AWAY!!!!

Seriously, this was horrible!

My husband and I stopped in on Friday afternoon (around 3:15ish) and there were 2 people in line ahead of us and the line grew behind us at a fast pace because things were not clicking behind the counter for employees.

- NO ONE was moving with ANY sense of urgency to take care of customers;
-The young girl taking orders couldn't have been any more obvious about NOT wanting to be at work or talking to people who were making orders;
-The store was absolutely filthy--EVERY SINGLE TABLE (literally) was filthy dirty and in terrible need of being wiped; 
-There was trash all over the floors, under tables, in main aisles, and the drink/condiment station was trashed!  (The picture that I submitted was under the "cleanest" table in the place that we had to sit at... Yes, this was the "cleanest" place to sit in the whole building);
-MIA Manager to prevent or correct any of it.

This place has a history of getting it wrong. Husband went through the drive through and ordered a grilled chicken salad, Big Mac meal and a Happy Meal. They handed him the drinks and two bags. Got home, no Happy Meal,. Went back for the Happy Meal ....and there was no toy. The Happy Meal was the only reason we decided on McDonalds in the first place.

The price is a bit high compared to other fast casual burgers but the quality of the ingredients and flavor profile left me so impressed that I stopped at the food court at Hopkins Airport the next day to have a Shake Shack burger despite knowing it probably wouldn't be as good as an actual standalone location.

Most people try to stay away from it, but it's nice to know that it's there when you need it. And maybe sometimes, even when you don't need it. When this place first opened, it was buzzing. Everyone was so excited to get a Shake Shack downtown, and credit to the company, they did a great job setting this up in a way that is amenable to a busy lunch setting. Good setup includes a winding line off to the side when you enter next to a large menu board (I so appreciate big menu boards in places like this!) and plenty of wide open seating as well as a buzzer system for food delivery. They were clearly prepared for the newly opened buzz because they had lots of folks working, and plenty of trainees too. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming, which is more than expect for a fast food restaurant. 
I've seen a lot of complaints that the prices here are high,  to which I say, I really think it depends on what you're comparing it to. I feel that Shake Shack offers a clean and spacious environment to enjoy your food in a heavily trafficked downtown area, as well as great service, so if the prices are a bit higher, I personally am okay with that. At the end of the day, their prices are comparable to Five Guys or Chick-fil-A, which I think are similar in their business model. Burgers are around $5-$6, $3.5 for cheese fries, and about $5 for shakes. 
The food itself again, is fast food,  but I do think it is prepared with more care than I expect for a this type of fare. I absolutely love how the burgers are neatly wrapped, making it easy to eat without making a huge mess. I was also weirdly impressed that their cheese fries somehow stay crispy even underneath all that gooey cheese. What is this sorcery of food science? The shakes are creamy and thick. It was cool to see they offered black sesame as a limited edition flavor, not something I'd order again, but enjoyable to try nonetheless. Overall, I think I can sum it up by saying I actually really enjoyed this. The portion sizes weren't gargantuan to the point of making you feel sick, and again, the food was prepared very neatly and with friendly service. I liked it so much that having tried it just before challenging myself with a month-long vegan diet, I spend the good first two weeks of my challenge thinking about how much I wanted to head back for another one of those cheeseburgers (which I did when my challenge was over). 
I think Shake Shack is worth a try if you are in the mood for something junky, but want to enjoy the food in a bit nicer atmosphere. It's worth the splurge and great service on top of that."

The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!

Forget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.

I concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it."

If you're not able to walk there I wish they had spots available out front or would validate for the garage next door. That's my feeling.

If it wasnt so close to where I live and convenient on nights where i dont feel like cooking or speding alot of money,  i'd drive to belle vernon instead of coming to this dump. 
My boyfriend always order a burger plain, with just cheese, and it never fails that they load it up with everything anyway, or even better, they realize they messed up, and then scrape all the condiments off, leaving a ketchup soaked bun that tastes like onions, rather than just tossing the bun lid and grabbing a new one. 
Tonight when we came here, my boyfriend returned his burger to the counter (as usual) and told the girl that he ordered plain. He politely showed her the ketchup soaked bun and she said "ok no problem" and went to the cook and showed him. The kid cooking grabbed the burger and screamed "it is plain!" Not realizing my boyfriend was standing at the counter and could hear every word. The cook started tearing the burger apart layer by layer, yelling that it was a plain sandwich, and he stuffed it back in the box and shoved it at the girl and said "give it back to him". The poor girl had no idea what to do, so she went and got the manager herself. In the meantime, my boyfriend tried to explain to the kid cooking that the bun was saturated and almost dripping with ketchup and the kid replied "that's not my problem". 
It took every ounce of patience and biting my tongue not to completely snap. Luckily the manager grabbed him right after she made my boyfriend a new burger and told him they had to have a talk.

Kitchen staff is uncomfortable to listen to and watch.

The same goes for the bathrooms.  Constantly dirty, out of toilet paper, or it reeks.

However, along the Euclid and E9 stretch, shake shack adds a nice update. Next to potbelly and across from the arcade, this location was right on time for burgers and fries. 

I went on the first day, so of course the service was Supreme. Everyone was smiling and happy. There was even a helpful manager going through the line asking if anyone has questions about the menu or needed help at all. I'll also say that there were ample employees preparing the food. Not sure if that will be the normal Staffing, but it sure was nice to see that they anticipated just what the lunch time rush in downtown could look like.

My burger was quality. Toasted bun, fresh toppings, cooked just right. My only gripe was the sauce. It's a mayo blend that just didn't work for me. I'd suggest getting it on the side if you're a first timer. Fries were crispy and yummy!

Even with the crowd, I got great service and a solid burger. Welcome downtown, Shake Shack!"	Shake Shack	601 Euclid Ave	Cleveland	OH	44113	40	1	Fast Food, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Burgers	-81.689174	41.500334

But what is up with the fake onion rings? There is some sort of processed onion pulp inside instead of simply battered onion slices? Another thing is their hash browns suck. They use some little tiny Ore-Ida tater tot disk instead of the large meaty patty like McDonalds and the cooking time for these is very unforgiving and easy to over cook and burn. They always seem burnt no matter what Burger King I go to around the country. Taco Johns manages to do the same tater tot disks properly. Furthermore, the oil they use to fry the hash browns in tastes very strongly of the long chicken sandwich they have on the menu and I don't really want that chicken sandwich flavor with my breakfast food.

The inside of the restaurant is spacious, and the staff were really friendly with great service. I got the SmokeShack with a side of fries, and my order was ready within only a few minutes of waiting. The burger and fries were pretty solid in terms of taste, and their shakes are a great dessert (I usually get the vanilla or strawberry one, but I was getting ice cream for dessert afterwards this time). It wasn't too busy when I went even though it was around dinner time, but since it only opened a few days ago I anticipate that it will get a lot busier over time.

As a mushroom lover, I was torn between the Shroom Burger or the Shake Stack. I tried the Shake Stack, it was gigantic, definitely didn't need THAT and a side of fries. But I did it anyways, and not just fries, CHEESY fries. I ate a weeks worth of calories in a meal. The fries are good, the cheese sauce is thick and creamy, definitely eat them hot, once cold I wasn't as into them but I think thats all cheesy fries. The burger was good, almost too cheesy actually. Very greasy, very messy, not enough bun to contain everything on the burger and I actually wish their was more of their signature sauce because I couldn't actually tell if it was on there or not. My verdict is, its good, might not be worth ALL the hype but definitely a good splurge meal once in a while.

One pays a premium for the satisfry, so one kinda expects them to appear in one's little baggy.  There were maybe 5 satisfries, one onion ring and 25 or so regular fries in my bag.
So I paid a premium and got whatever fell out of the fry baskets onto the catch-tray beneath.
Everything in my bag was cold and not very good.  
The lady, who's satisfries were more prevalent in her order than mine, tasted them and just set them aside.

Burger King, for obvious reasons, put up huge signs threatening to tow people who parked in their lot to go to Five Guys. There are probably 20 parking spaces. 

The food is good, unhealthy for sure, but tasty. I can not make it through a 'regular' burger which is two hunks of meat, but the small burger works out well. There is no need to get more than a large order of fries for 3 or 4 people since they fill the fry container and then a huge portion of the bag. My only criticism about their menu is the lack of options for children. They offer grilled cheese, which is their regular buns with cheese and whatever else you want on there but it is rather pricey. In fact the entire menu is a little on the steep side for burgers and fries, but it is worth it for a treat every once in a while."

You get a bacon cheeseburger, 4 nuggets, fries, a drink, and a cookie. The cookie is the 5th item Wendy's doesn't offer (they have 4 for $4). Wendy's definitely beats them in quality and flavor. My bacon cheeseburger was sloppy and dry tasting. Fries were good. Nuggets tasted like the big cheap bag you can get at Walmart and had soggy spots.

I have gotten to where I order small fries because they overload the fry cup so much. Plus, I would much rather eat the peanuts than the fries anyway. This particular store is in the historic Steelyard area, close to several big box stores and other chain restaurants. I found the burgers consistent with every other 5 Guys I have been to, and the staff in this store was particularly friendly. It wasn't crowded the night I was there, but it was home opening day for the Indians.

This location is up to the high standards set by other locations I have visited.  Friendly service, quality products.  I was able to preorder using the Five Guys iPhone app and picked up my order.  One warning, the fries are HUGE!  A standard order will easily feed two.  My kids love the soda dispensers, which are programmed to dispense many different flavors and types of soda.  They also have a similar ice tea dispenser.  New location, clean, and great service.  Worth a visit.

Wait times in the drive-thru are way beyond normal and there is never any explanation. On September 21, I had completed a mobile order but could tell as soon as I arrived that in spite of very few cars it was going to be a long wait. Being bored, I decided to time the action. 3 cars ahead of me, customer waited at the order here speaker for 6 full minutes before being waited on. 2 cars ahead of me, it was 2 minutes. 1 car ahead of me, it was 7 minutes. Once it was my turn, it was only 2 minutes but I decided to say "hello" to get their attention. I don't know, maybe the new speaker system doesn't register when cars drive up. The person behind me took 3 minutes to get waited on. Only the second drive-thru window was open. I got my food 25 minutes after first getting in line. That is just CRAZY. I asked the young man what was going on, and he said there were not enough employees and there were many people in the dining room. I only saw maybe 7 cars in the parking lot, some of which had to belong to employees, so I'm skeptical. I wish I could say this was an isolated incident, but I see it regularly when driving past the store or when I make the mistake of trying again.

I'm writing this review because the customer service is poor here. Also if you're interested in people watching, this is the good place to do it. There's so many obvious drug addicts here. 

The location is convenient because it's in the middle of downtown Pittsburgh. The service is definitely lackluster. I put in my online order last compared to my coworkers. I somehow received my order first. I have been waiting for the other orders to be complete but it's been at least 15 minutes.

After a day of Holiday shopping in Steelyard (Target, Marshalls, Bath & Body Works, Petco, and Home Depot) I was ready for a quick bite to eat.  Went to another burger joint across the street and was ignored, and left after about 10 minutes, still hungry.  I drove across the street to Five Guys and was greeted with a smile and a short wait time.  I enjoyed the little bacon cheeseburger, cajun fries and the variety of Coca-Cola that they offer in their hi-tech dispenser.  I was back on the road in no time, no longer hungry or irritable.

I will say in general this particular shop is pretty consistent.  It is busy being so close to Kent St.  So my top tip is if you go in and it is NOT busy, and the folks behind the counter are not at the ready, skip the fries.  I have been there when they are super busy and the fries are great.  And I have been when they are not busy.  The burgers are constantly good.  But the fries are unfortunately soft, under cooked and without seasoning.  I am not sure of the issue, but the common denominator is how busy they are.

It appears it has all new employees, true they've been with the restaurant probably since it re-opened in December. They need to get them retrained as in how to do their jobs. The pre-remodeled place while not the best looking had much better employees. This one... It is a clean and nice looking place, but the inside wait time is horrible. As it is in quite a few McDonalds, they feel it's more important to get as many orders and the money first and make the customer wait in a line to receive their food. Some take it to the extreme and actually place more emphasis on the drive through orders than they do the eat in. I've actually started going to the one on Steels Corners road which is a couple of miles further away, because if you eat in, you don't have the feeling of having to wait until the cars are served first.

I usually get a bacon double cheeseburger with the works. They offer a lot of toppings and they are all free.  The burger is so big it's hard to bite, but you'll figure it out.  Their Cajun fries are off the charts, and they HOOK..IT..UP! The bottom of your bag is always filled with em'.  

For a place where you get your food in five minutes, you can't beat it. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it is a little expensive. You can easily spend 12 bucks here if you get a double cheeseburger, fries and a drink.

My favorite thing about Five Guys is that they offer peanuts while you wait.  That's right, you can enjoy the nuts of Five Guys in your mouth for free.

  I always keep this quote from Arnold in the back of my mind if I eat fast food.  Dont fill up, eat just enough.  Burgers here are pretty tasty.  Had one here after a 3 day bender of boxed wine and pumpernickle loaf.  Anything greasy would of tasted good at that stage I guess.  Heard the fries are good and the soda comes in 7,000 flavors if thats your thing.  Only time I drink soda at all is if there's vodka in it.  Thing I dig most about this place is that its off in the cut and the parking lot makes a great place to meet up with your dealer.

Their burgers are top notch. They have a very classic, old-time-griddle flavor. They have managed to find the perfect, classic combination of burger, bun, and cheese. And they have a slew of toppings that you can add on at no additional cost.

They also have delicious, made in house French fries. Order the small though, as the small is roughly the size of an XL anywhere else! You get a full container of fries, topped with another scoop of fries that goes right into the bag.

In the mood for something sweet? Try one of their mouthwatering, thick milkshakes. With tons of flavors and add ins, they have a flavor to match any craving you may have.

Overall, give them a try. They are pricey for a burger/fries, but they are worth it for their quality and flavor."	Five Guys	623 E Main St	Kent	OH	44240	25	1	Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food, American (New), Sandwiches	-81.3488544	41.1540398

15 mins from ordering?!?  4 cars behind me got their food and drove out b4 my order ready?!?  White construction van had breakfast food too, as I heard him order. 
I did not order a made to order Quarter Pounder!  It was a simple McGriddle!  
I told girl who brought it out that I waited 15 mins. Her reply was, I don't cook it. I said I realize that, but a simple 1 sandwich order with fries and drink should not take 15 mins. She replied again, I don't cook it.  Talk to the manager!  Ya, just what u want to do. Get out of the car and go inside and ask for the manager!  That is why you do the drive thru-you not eating in, drive thru line was not long, so you use it!  I told the girl...you do not cook it, but I guess no one cooks if it took 15 mins!  And if you wait 8 mins before you even get to the cashier window b/c someone at the pick up window that long, you would think a McGriddle would be ready by the time you got to the window!  Nope!  You gotta wait another 7 mins!!!!
And no one gives a darn about how long it took!  
Burger King across the road--better, nicer, and faster!  Will go there!  
And, should be no pay 1st window here!!!  Pay when you get the food-so they cannot hold you captive 15 mins!  Awful service!  No care or concern from employees!  Lots of job openings, hard to find employees--but train the ones you do have!  Teach them to read orders when it comes up on screen!  Teach them to start the cooking!  Teach them, train them that no cells when working!!!  Teach employees how to talk to customers.  Not, I don't cook it!  Apologize for delays, offer a coupon for a 15 min delay!!!

Service always slow, but today several cars were waiting for food.  I waited almost 10 minutes and had to leave to go to an appointment at the top of the hour so I asked for a refund.  The manager on duty very sarcastically made the comment that it wasn't their fault someone had ordered 12 sandwiches a few cars in front of me and then proceeded to tell me that "for your information your sandwiches we're being wrapped now" as she returned my money.  Nothing like polite customer service!  Will be going to McDonald's in the future.	Burger King	4150 State Route 306	Willoughby	OH	44094	14	1	Burgers, Restaurants, Fast Food	-81.3735395	41.6390033

The area is super with lots of nice seating and everything was clean. That's a great start with me. The eating area is off set, so it feels private too! 

The staff at the register recommended the Smoke Shack over the shroom, so why not. I also got fries and strawberry shake. The clerk smiled and was friendly. Checkout easy, but ouch on $17+ I was given a buzzer. 

Food was out in less than 10 minutes and hot. There is a condiment area to side with ketchup, mustard, straws and napkins. The area was clean. 

The burger was very good, not great. I liked the bacon and burger tasty. But did not care for the peppers which seemed overly spicy. Fries meh! Strawberry shake good.

As soon as I entered the door I noticed the clean and inviting environment with the red and white American diner look. It was not very crowded, so there was no wait to order. I purchased a bacon burger, fries, and a milkshake. Only a couple minutes after the order, my milkshake was ready to hold me over until the burger and fries were cooked. The milkshake was the perfect amount of thickness, although I would not recommend ordering the whipped cream on top because it lacked some sweetness. As soon as I began to wonder where my food was, I heard them call our number. The burger was fresh and juicy. However, I was disappointed when I realized I had forgotten to order ketchup and the ketchup dispenser was empty. Luckily, they had the little packets. The fries were also fresh cooked and had just the right amount of salt. This is truly the perfect restaurant to eat a quick, yet quality meal.

Got the 2 for $5 deal where I chose the Big Fish Sandwich and Extra Long Cheeseburger.  Sandwiches were nothing to write home about but a different taste from McD's and Arby's.

Even with a somewhat organized manner where one person where shouting out orders and passing the brown bags, it took an extraordinarily long time before you got your food (20 mins for mine).  Of course, by the time you actually are able to eat it, it's cold (no tables to eat with small dining area and most of the space are filled with people waiting for their orders).  My colleagues waited for 25 minutes while everyone else got their order.  Finally, they went up to inquire about it and the employees realized those orders got "lost in the mix".  Wow, 30 minutes to get your lunch.

I am sure it will get better in time here but the initial layout and planning of space did not allow adequate  room to accommodate the lunch rush anticipated.

Because of the reputation, I was expecting the restaurant to be lively and energetic. Not the case. The front line was very friendly but I didn't get the vibe I thought I was going to get. Much to Hopkins credit the airport prices are reasonable so when I saw the prices at Shake Shack I had to pick and choose carefully. I opted for the grilled hot dog and a shake. The dog wasn't much to write home about and they only had catsup and mustard for toppings. Onions and relish would have been nice. While pricey, the white and black shake was the star here. Very much reminded me of summer cookouts with vanilla ice cream and Hershey's chocolate syrup out of the can.

One of my favorite things is how customizable the burgers are, and the extra toppings don't cost anything. You can load up the burger with grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, peppers, jalapeños, pickles and different sauces at no extra charge. If you order online, you can select each topping and tell them if you want a regular, light, or heavy amount of each individual topping. 

A regular burger comes with two patties. Their "little burger" option is the same size as a regular, just has one patty instead.

I also love their fries. You can tell there is something a little different, and that difference is the peanut oil they use to fry them. A "little" fry order is anything but little. My wife and I split a "little" and there's enough for both of us and then some. They were piling out the cup and there was also like 20 fries in the bottom of our takeout bag. If you do get it to go, they'll wait for you to arrive to fry them, so there's no sogginess going on.

I am very grateful for McDonald's being all over the US for the use of their bathrooms. I haven't eaten in a McDonald's in 20 years. I would've given a one star except for the fact that I'm very happy that I can use their bathroom. LOL the reason for the low Reading even though I didn't eat any food here is due to the fact that the floor was absolutely disgusting. From the moment I walked in the door the floor was like ice from Greece. The bathroom floor was the same way and sticky too. If they maintain the floors and they're eating area and their bathrooms where all the customers can see it I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like.

How can the McDonald's be so bad in champaign. We came here on a Sunday night excepting "fast food" since we had a couple of coupons for free medium fries and drink with the purchase of a large sandwich. I went ahead and ordered a bacon clubhouse burger with fries and a drink expecting that this may take a few minutes. 20 minutes afterwards they finally call my number. They decided it was a priority to serve all 4 cars in the drive thru before me. I have never had to wait so long for McD. Of course the new bacon clubhouse burger had a new bun and really the same type of meat. This was not worth waiting for 20 minutes. The manager had the audacity to congratulate the staff on a job well done after we were all served. READ MY LIPS, I AM NEVER GOING TO THIS MCDONALD AGAIN. You write a complain about it to McD and you get a nice call from Stacy from the regional branch. Really no fixes. To make matters worse they have a chaulk board saying 40 something days since the last complaint. Are you kidding me, this is one of the worst mcdonalds every.

Pro: None!

Cons: So slow, it should not be called fast food. Unapologetic.

I am kind of drooling right now just thinking about them. However they are also incredibly greasy so I can't see them being very healthy. This is the sort of thing that I will have to reserve as a special treat for myself every few months, and now that Burgatory is open right next door, I can really only recommend them if you are in a hurry.

Additionally, the little bacon burger that I got with the endless free toppings can be customized just the way you like it. 

Other than that, the quality of the food is okay, I always wished that the grilled mushrooms were cooked a bit more but other than that, the burger usually taste okay, comparable to other fast food joints. There's also the box of free peanuts on top of the trash cans, which doesn't seem like the best place to put it but I imagine it's to save space."

Went their on Saturday about 7:00. In short, the guy at the register was not the nicest. I hadn't been there before and was trying to figure out the menu. He said he would explain, but really didn't. Just said the regular burgers have two patties and the little burgers have one. He was kind of impatient and then to make it worse got my order wrong. (Left off a topping I chose from their rather long list). By the time I noticed I figured "whatever". It's sort of awkward standing around waiting for your order - their really isn't a good area except in front of the soda machine. 

Good news is the food was rather tasty. Not the best burger I ever had, but pretty darn good. Fries could have been more crispy - but they were fresh with the skin on and tasted good.

Come on McD's. 1st off they couldn't take two separate orders in drive thru, so had to go inside. Once inside my order which was a big breakfast and oatmeal took way to long to get.

Not the first time I've had issues at this location either! Ordered a kids meal for my 21 month old, asked for chocolate milk got fruit punch. We got apple slices instead of fries for him as well...they were molded, can't really tell from the outside of the bag except they had a lot of brown spots, so I opened them and they smelled horrible! Thank goodness I checked them or my son would have probably eaten a few. I have tried to call the store 5 times now and have gotten no answer. Besides all this, service was very slow, only 4-5 cars in drive through and maybe a few customers inside to go with the 8+ employees standing around inside.

However, at the leat I would expect to be treated as an adult human being when talked to by another human being. My example started out simple enough. They got my order wrong. No huge deal. I asked for no onion and no mayo on my burger, which happened to be a double whopper. I had ordered through the drive through with my wife because we were pressed for time before a movie started. We started eating in the movie theatre parking lot, and I noticed that my burger had the two things that I asked not to be on it, after the drive thru repeated it back to me "double whopper, no onion no mayo". Again, not a deal breaker. I called and informed them that my burger was wrong. The guy who answered put who I could only assume was his manager, She Satan. She answered the phone and said, "Yeah, you got a problem with your burger?" No hello, nothing. I said,"Yeah I ordered my burger with no mayo and no onion." She said, "I find that hard to believe since our burgers don't come with onion or mayo." Now I am getting a little perturbed. You start off the phone call rudely, then you accuse your customer of lying. I said, "I am looking at it right now, and it has both on my Double Whopper." She said, "Oh, Double Whopper? That isn't a burger. " Get the hell over yourself lady. After that, she was just playing with me. I said, "Nevermond, I am never returning to this place again."

The service is rarely friendly or accommodating. I go to McDonald's expecting to be treated like I'm bothering the employees with my presence and to have sub-par food, but my experience at this McDonald's was BEYOND bad service. It was down right terrible. My boyfriend and I went to get a couple parfaits to enjoy after grocery shopping. We ordered, pulled up to the window, paid for our parfaits and were told to pull forward because it would take a few minutes to get them ready. We watched all four cars behind us get food and leave. We waited oh so very patiently for fifteen more minutes. It was late so only the drive-thru was open. We could not go inside to see what was up. So, we reversed back to the window. Inside we could see three employees just standing around. My boyfriend knocked on the window to get their attention and all three of them looked at us and walked away out of view. We waited another 10 mins, bringing our total wait time to about half an hour, before one of them came to the window to tell us they were out of the stuff to make parfaits. Why, in God's name, did it take half an hour to tell us that? The only reason we got a refund was because we refused to leave until we got one. They didn't offer any kind of condolences for making us wait that long. They seemed annoyed with us for actually sticking around to get our food. I'm convinced that they thought by walking away from the window, it would get us to give up and drive away. No, you took my money and didn't give me anything. So rude.

Bacon Cheeseburger: If you haven't been to Five Guys before, your burgers are totally customizable. I'm a fan of lettuce, mayo, and jalapenos. You do what you like."	Five Guys	8234 Greenway Blvd	Middleton	WI	53562	51	1	Fast Food, Restaurants, Burgers, Hot Dogs	-89.5241067527	43.0906280441

For a burger and fries, Five Guys is it for me. The best burger in town hands-down, and they're fries are up there with some of the best fresh cut boardwalk fries in the business. 

In addition to burgers, Five Guys also offers hot dogs, chicken sandwiches and vegetarian options as well. I can only recommend the burgers as I haven't tried anything else, but that's only because I haven't felt the need to. 

They're burgers are absolutely mouthwateringly delicious. If you're an average person a "little" burger and a "little" size fries is more than enough to satisfy your appetite. If you want to go for their the standard size, be prepared for potential meat sweats and a food coma upon completion. It's too much for me. Seriously, a "little" size fries are enough to properly feed 2-4 people. 

The only point that should be noted for anyone with peanut allergies; stay away!!! They're fries are fried in peanut oil, and salted peanuts are available by the caseful throughout the restaurant for patrons to snack on while they wait for their meals (free of charge). It's a nice perk for the rest of us, but for those with an allergy should probably steer clear. 

Other than that, if you want a great burger, and friendly service, in a fast food-type family oriented environment, skip the other guys and head straight to Five Guys."	Five Guys	15171 Pearl Rd	Strongsville	OH	44136	5	1	Burgers, Restaurants, Fast Food	-81.834509	41.305616

I prefer burgers rare to medium-rare, nicely seasoned, dripping juices, and hugged by a bun that's not too bread-y.  The focus should be on the meat, though toppings are an important part of my overall burger experience as well.

I eat fast food very, very rarely.  Though, as mentioned above, I don't prefer beef cooked a whole lot, I can dig a tasty well-done patty.  For me, Five Guys falls into this category.  This Five Guys location in Robinson is the only one I've ever visited anywhere, and it made me and my mom happy after a long day at the hair salon, shopping, and driving.

A summary of my experience:
* The staff was delightful.
* The music playing--mostly '80s stuff--was fun.
* The dining area and restrooms were clean.
* The complimentary toppings I chose for my burger--grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, tomato, and mayo--were executed nicely and present in good quantity.
* The generic bun, which I don't usually like, worked fine here.
* The skin-on fries are greasy, and the way they're thrown into a brown paper bag with a cup isn't cute to me.  I can resist these fries.

Are all wendy's made alike, not likely. I would agree with some of the other negative reviews per other yelpers. This location is not managed well. You have some very sassy employees that are not all that friendly. When they take your order it is almost like you are interrupting them from their conversation. The food itself came out great without complaints. Fresh and hot, but the employees really should be managed better.

Pro: fresh burgers, fast food inexpensive

Cons: poor employee training, busy talking with each other instead of doing their job

The burger patties and toppings are fine, and I love that you customize it just the way you want it with a wide variety of available toppings and sauces.  The plain sesame seed buns are the worst part of the sandwich, especially after getting soggy when the hot burger is wrapped in foil whether or not you eat in or take it out.  The cajun fries are really good, and you get a ton of them even if you order the small.  I know digging through the fries to get to the sandwich at the bottom of the paper bag is part of the Five Guys experience, but I'd rather get that burger out of the foil right away.

The employees are always super friendly, from taking the order to thanking you as they hand you your food.  The biggest problem I've had is that my order has been screwed up way too often.  I like that they don't cook your food until you order, but it still seems like it takes too much time since the thin patties shouldn't take long to cook ... maybe it's the fries that take longer.  One time, after waiting 20+ minutes after placing my order during a slow time of the day, and seeing people who ordered after me get their food, I asked what was going on and found out my order had vanished into thin air.  So, I had to wait another 10 minutes while they made my food, but at least they refunded my money.

I've been at he hospital with my fiancé all day so I yelped the nearest fast food location and this establishment popped up. I was in the drive thru waiting to order my food and decided to read the previous reviews to base how my extra details needed to complete my order. Reading the reviews let me needing to add that my Spicy Chicken sandwich and fry needed to be made fresh. The employee on the receiving side completely ignored me the entire time and continue to cut me off telling me to pull forward when I asked if she heard my order correctly. After asking twice I gave up trying to communicate with her and proceeded to pull forward as I was rudely instructed to do. Once I got the window the employee continued to ignore me for about 2 minutes and then finally decided to take my card and said, "I hope you plan to wait about 6 minutes since you want your food fresh". Based on the past reviews I didn't hesitate to say, "no problem, I don't mind the wait". She handed me my card back and I pulled forward to the next window. Upon arriving to the window, two other employees said for me to pull forward and they would bring my fresh food out to me, I waited for about 3 minutes and my food was delivered to my car and I proceeded to drive back to the hospital. Once I parked, I opened my bag and was amazed at how fresh and juicy the sandwich was. I went in for my 3rd bite and notice the sandwich was completely raw and damn near had a heart beat. This location needs to be completely burned to the ground and revamped.	Wendy's	3735 Pearl Road	Cleveland	OH	44109	5	1	Burgers, Fast Food, Restaurants	-81.7011334	41.4533186

This place seemed a little empty on a Saturday evening, but that just means less of a line. The prices do seem a little high here for burgers (but they are double patty so maybe it is justified), but just a bacon cheeseburger came out to around $9. There were plenty of available peanuts, as per usual and the cajun fries were tasty (also as per usual).

For our order, they completely messed it up and still addd mustard and forgot to put in grilled mushrooms and onions, but that's no big deal. This is just a regular old chain restaurant."

The drive-thru line was busy, maybe 8 cars. I dined in, and that line had about 2 or 3 couples ahead of me plus at least that many waiting for their food after ordering. One unenthusiastic young lady working the register. A whole bunch of workers running around that didn't accomplish much but burned a lot of energy doing it, and all of them were churlish to customers. Took about 10 minutes waiting to order and 10 more to get the food. One ice machine was empty, there was some metal thing sitting askew under the beverage spigots, which made it tough to get a drink. No salt, pepper, etc., just napkins and straws. The french fries had zero salt, so salt shakers or packets would have been nice. I am not from the area, but I wouldn't return anyway if I were.

I did try to order a second pretzel bacon king as a double, but they didn't make the leap to take a pretzel bacon king and add a meat patty and cheese to it and charge me for the additions, so I ended up just not ordering it. I guess maybe the conversation with the drive thru person confused the make table person and they forgot how to make the pretzel bacon king with a pretzel bun instead of the standard bun."

When I pulled in I should have just pulled out and headed elsewhere.  I was going to use the drive thru, as I sat there in line I thought maybe it'll be quicker if I go inside.  The line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building.  So I back out of line, park and head inside.  I, at first, thought this was a brilliant idea.  When I walked in there was only one person in line ordering.  But looks can be deceiving.  That one person ordered what was like several meals to go, but there were also two people before that had ordered, so technically still backed up.

When it is finally my turn to place my order and I approach the counter I am told that I would need to wait a minute.  I was fine with that, but a minute turned into five.  And so on.  I can understand fulfilling orders but multitask.  Take my order as the fries are frying.  Finally get to place my order and the girl that took my order was a bright spot her.  Friendly, smiling and accommodating.  She listened to my order and placed it how I had ordered it on the screen.  Ensuring me that what I had said was heard.  I had wanted the lemonade, but no dice there.  They were out and I didn't want to wait for them to make more.  I mean I was here for a quick meal and head on my way.

So I go over and get my drink, some napkins and wait for my food to be packaged up for me.  This took at least another five minutes.  I had seen my sandwiches sitting there waiting for me to eat them, but not in a bag.  

Let's circle back to the beginning here.  Remember how I thought going inside would be faster.  Nope, about the same amount of time, if not longer.  A bit irritating there, at least I didn't waste gas sitting in the drive thru line.  Also, remember me saying that they took my order and showed me it on the screen.  Well the one sandwich was done totally wrong.  Not a big fan of ketchup and ended up with that on my sandwich.  And sorry, but no matter what you do, the sandwich is already tainted by that taste and smell."

Massive amounts of customers, most only there for a 1 dollar coffee or soda and then the slow processing time of debit cards or cash exchanges and at times some seriously long delivery times at the food window exacerbates the situation.  I ordered a biscuit after breakfast hours and instead of crusty and delicious, it's clearly suffered through a microwave AND taken five minutes at the window to get it to me. Why even OFFER all day breakfast if you're just going to put it in a microwave. I could buy a damned Jimmy Dean frozen biscuit and get the same crap at home without having to wait 10,000 years in line!!! Point being... stop microwaving your biscuits. It's disgusting.

This store has been a nightmare for the last 8 years we've been here. It's the closest McDonald's to us and sometimes you HAVE to go there or travel to another one but I will tell you this, I have never had "Great" service there or "Great" food. There is ALWAYS an attitude problem there, ALWAYS!! The drive thru at night needs to be investigated by the owner because they are losing a ton of money from them telling people they are out of food and this is all the time. The store is dirty as hell ALL THE TIME, and every person working there is on their phones, probably the reason all the mistakes are made. 
HORRIBLE MCDONALDS, try Wendy's right down the hill"	McDonald's	4214 Brownsville Rd	Brentwood	PA	15227	24	1	Restaurants, Food, Burgers, Coffee & Tea, Fast Food	-79.9838682137	40.3646352888
