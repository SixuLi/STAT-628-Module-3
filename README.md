# STAT-628-Module-3
In this project, based on Yelp data set, we intended to use some NLP techniques and machine learning based methods to abstract specific information, and to propose data-driven, actionable suggestions to some business owners based on these mined information in order to improve the quality of their food or service. In particular, we focused on five famous fast-food chains—McDonald’s, Burger King, Five Guys, Wendy’s, and Shake Shack.
